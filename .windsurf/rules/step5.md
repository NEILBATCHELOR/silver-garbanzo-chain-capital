 5. File Organization and Management
- When creating new files, folders, and pages, search the codebase for an existing appropriate location unless directed; prefer not to create new files and folders.
- Always keep files and folders consistently organized and prevent duplication (e.g., avoid `investor` and `investors` folders).
- Keep README docs and scripts organized by function:
  - Docs: `/Users/neilbatchelor/silver-garbanzo-chain-capital/docs` (always add general/progress/functional READMEs; be specific with naming).
  - Fixes: `/Users/neilbatchelor/silver-garbanzo-chain-capital/fix` (always add fix READMEs; be specific with naming).
  - Scripts: `/Users/neilbatchelor/silver-garbanzo-chain-capital/scripts`.
  - Tests and testing: Always add backend tests to `backend/add-tests`.
- Keep all files organized with clear folder names.
- Use and update README files where available.
- Do not create multiple services or types files with an 'enhanced' prefix. Instead search for the file required and edit and enhance the existing file.
- For segregated functionality create separate agile services and types files.
- CREATE A README TO SUMMARIZE NEW OR UPDATED FUNCTIONALITY.
- Always add a index file to folders to keep exports up to date and organized.
