-- Fix constraint on user_roles table that's preventing role creation/updates

-- Check if constraint exists and drop it

-- Now add a more permissive check constraint that includes all the roles we need

-- Update RLS policies to be inclusive of all of our role names (camelCase and snake_case)
-- This allows both naming conventions to work with access control
