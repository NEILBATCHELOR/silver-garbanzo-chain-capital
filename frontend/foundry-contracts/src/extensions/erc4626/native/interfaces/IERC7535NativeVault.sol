/**
 * @title IERC7535NativeVault
 * @notice Interface for ERC-7535 Native ETH Vault extension
 * @dev Extends ERC-4626 to accept native ETH deposits without wrapping
 * 
 * Key Benefits:
 * - No WETH wrapping required (saves ~40,000 gas)
 * - Better UX (users don't need WETH)
 * - No approval needed for ETH
 * 
 * Standard Flow:
 * 1. User sends ETH → Module wraps to WETH internally
 * 2. Module deposits WETH into vault
 * 3. User receives vault shares
 * 
 * Withdrawal:
 * 1. User burns shares
 * 2. Module withdraws WETH from vault
 * 3. Module unwraps WETH → sends ETH to user
