# Type System Fixes for Token Components

## Summary of Changes

We've fixed several type inconsistencies in the token-related components by ensuring property names follow the correct camelCase format in the frontend components while maintaining snake_case in the database communication layer.

### Files Fixed

1. **TokenVersionHistoryContainer.tsx**
   - Changed `version.created_at` to `version.createdAt` to match the TokenVersion interface

2. **TokenDetail.tsx**
   - Changed `created_by` to `createdBy` in the `mapVersionData` function

3. **versionHistoryService.ts**
   - Updated the version comparison object to use `createdAt` instead of `created_at`
   - Fixed the mapping in `getTokenVersionHistory` function to use `createdBy` instead of `created_by`
   - Kept `created_by` as-is where it's used in the database operations

4. **src/types/tokens/index.ts**
   - Updated the `mapTokenVersionDbToDomain` function to use `createdBy` instead of `created_by`

## Type System Compliance

These changes ensure our codebase follows the type system architecture guidelines:

1. **Database Types** (snake_case)
   - Field names: `created_at`, `created_by`
   - Used in direct database operations with supabase

2. **Domain Types** (camelCase)
   - Property names: `createdAt`, `createdBy`
   - Used in React components and business logic

3. **Type Mappers**
   - Properly transform between snake_case and camelCase when moving data between layers

## Validation

All linter errors related to these type mismatches have been resolved, ensuring type safety and maintaining the proper separation between database and domain models.
