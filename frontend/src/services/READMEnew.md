# `/src/services` â€” READMEnew.md

This folder contains all business logic, service modules, and integration layers for the application. Each subfolder encapsulates a specific domain or feature area, providing clean APIs for use by pages and components. Services handle data fetching, transformation, orchestration, and external integrations.

## Usage
- Import and use service modules for business logic, data orchestration, and external integrations.
- Extend subfolders as new domains or features are added.
- Keep business logic out of pages/components for maintainability.

## Developer Notes
- All services are TypeScript-typed and designed for modular import.
- Follow domain-driven folder structure for scalability and clarity.
- Keep documentation (`READMEnew.md`) up to date as new services are added or updated.
