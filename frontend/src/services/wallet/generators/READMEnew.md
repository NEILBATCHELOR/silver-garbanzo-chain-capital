# `/src/services/wallet/generators` â€” READMEnew.md

This folder contains wallet generator classes for multiple blockchains, providing a unified interface for programmatically generating wallets (address, private key, metadata) for EVM, Bitcoin, Solana, Stellar, Aptos, NEAR, Sui, Polygon, XRP, and more. It centralizes wallet creation logic for onboarding, user flows, and developer utilities.

## Files

- **AptosWalletGenerator.ts**: Implements wallet generation and address validation for Aptos.
- **BTCWalletGenerator.ts**: Implements wallet generation and address validation for Bitcoin.
- **ETHWalletGenerator.ts**: Implements wallet generation and address validation for Ethereum/EVM.
- **NEARWalletGenerator.ts**: Implements wallet generation and address validation for NEAR.
- **PolygonWalletGenerator.ts**: Implements wallet generation and address validation for Polygon (EVM-compatible).
- **SolanaWalletGenerator.ts**: Implements wallet generation and address validation for Solana.
- **StellarWalletGenerator.ts**: Implements wallet generation and address validation for Stellar.
- **SuiWalletGenerator.ts**: Implements wallet generation and address validation for Sui.
- **XRPWalletGenerator.ts**: Implements wallet generation and address validation for XRP.
- **WalletGeneratorFactory.ts**: Factory class for selecting/generating the correct wallet generator based on blockchain type.

## Usage
- Use these generators to create wallets for onboarding, user flows, or developer tools across supported blockchains.
- Extend with new blockchains by adding a new generator and updating the factory.

## Developer Notes
- All logic is TypeScript-typed and implements a common interface for consistency.
- Placeholder logic is used for some chains; production should use official SDKs/libraries.
- Keep documentation (`READMEnew.md`) up to date as new blockchains or features are added.
