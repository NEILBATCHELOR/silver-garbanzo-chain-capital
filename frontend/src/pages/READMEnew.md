# `/src/pages` â€” READMEnew.md

This folder contains all top-level route pages for the application. Each file or subfolder represents a distinct route or a set of related routes, often corresponding to a major feature or workflow. Pages are typically composed of atomic and domain-specific components, and are responsible for orchestrating UI, data fetching, and navigation logic.
