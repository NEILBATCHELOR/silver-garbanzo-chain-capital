# Layout Components

## Overview
The Layout components define the structural framework of the application, including navigation, headers, and content containers. These components ensure consistent page structure throughout the application.

## Components

- **Header.tsx**: Top navigation bar component with branding, navigation controls, and user menu.
- **Sidebar.tsx**: Side navigation component with menu items, collapsible sections, and navigation links.
- **PageHeader.tsx**: Component that provides standardized page headers with title, description, and action buttons.
