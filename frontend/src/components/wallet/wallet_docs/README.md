# Wallet Components Implementation

This document provides an overview of the wallet components implementation, focusing on transaction handling, error management, and MultiSig functionality.

## Core Components

### Transaction Confirmation

The `TransactionConfirmation` component provides a comprehensive user interface for displaying transaction status and details to users.

**Features:**
- Displays transaction status (pending, confirmed, failed)
- Shows transaction details including amount, from/to addresses, and timestamp
- Provides transaction hash with copy and explorer link functionality
- Animated progress indicator for pending transactions
- Success and error visuals with appropriate messaging
- Supports retry and back navigation

**Usage Example:**
```tsx
<TransactionConfirmation 
  txHash="0x123..."
  status="pending"
  title="Transfer Processing"
  description="Your transfer is being processed on the blockchain"
  details={{
    from: "My Wallet",
    to: "0x456...",
    amount: "1.5",
    asset: "ETH",
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
  }}
  onBack={() => setCurrentView("home")}
  onRetry={() => retryTransaction()}
/>
```

### Error Display

The `ErrorDisplay` component provides standardized error handling with user-friendly messages and suggestions.

**Features:**
- Maps error codes to user-friendly messages
- Provides actionable suggestions for common errors
- Supports compact and detailed display modes
- Includes technical details for debugging
- Common solutions accordion for self-help
- Retry and back navigation buttons

**Usage Example:**
```tsx
<ErrorDisplay
  errorCode="INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS"
  error={errorMessage}
  onRetry={() => retryTransaction()}
  onBack={() => setCurrentView("home")}
/>
```

### MultiSig Transaction Confirmation

The `MultiSigTransactionConfirmation` component handles the complex flow of multi-signature transactions.

**Features:**
- Displays signature collection progress
- Shows which owners have signed and which need to sign
- Indicates when threshold is reached
- Provides signing functionality for eligible users
- Includes sharing capabilities for coordinating signatures
- Real-time updates of confirmation status

**Usage Example:**
```tsx
<MultiSigTransactionConfirmation
  transactionId="tx-123"
  walletId="wallet-456"
  title="Multisig Transfer"
  description="This transfer requires multiple signatures"
  details={{
    from: "Team Wallet",
    to: "0x789...",
    amount: "5.0",
    asset: "ETH",
  }}
  threshold={3}
  owners={["0x111...", "0x222...", "0x333..."]}
  canSign={true}
  onSignTransaction={handleSignTransaction}
  onShareTransaction={handleShareTransaction}
  onBack={() => setCurrentView("home")}
/>
```

## Integration

These components have been integrated into the following pages:

### SwapPage

The SwapPage has been updated to use the TransactionConfirmation and ErrorDisplay components for comprehensive transaction feedback.

**Key Integration Points:**
- Transaction processing state uses TransactionConfirmation
- Success state uses TransactionConfirmation with confirmed status
- Error state uses ErrorDisplay with appropriate error mapping
- Enhanced error handling in executeSwap function

### TransferPage

The TransferPage has been updated to support both standard and MultiSig transactions with appropriate confirmation UIs.

**Key Integration Points:**
- Added MultiSig detection on wallet selection
- Implemented MultiSig proposal flow
- Added signature collection for MultiSig transactions
- Enhanced standard transaction confirmation
- Improved error handling with ErrorDisplay

## Enhanced MultiSigWalletManager

The MultiSigWalletManager has been enhanced with additional functionality:

**New Methods:**
- `getTransaction` - Fetch a specific transaction by ID
- Comprehensive test coverage for all methods

**Integration:**
- MultiSig transaction proposals are now properly tracked
- Signature collection is implemented
- Transaction status monitoring is in place

## Usage Guidelines

### Standard Transaction Flow

1. Use TransactionConfirmation during processing state
2. Update status based on blockchain confirmations
3. Handle errors with ErrorDisplay component

### MultiSig Transaction Flow

1. Detect if selected wallet is a MultiSig wallet
2. Use proposeTransaction for creating transactions
3. Display MultiSigTransactionConfirmation for signature collection
4. Allow signing through the UI
5. Track confirmation progress

## Remaining Tasks

- [ ] Implement MultiSig UI flows in additional wallet pages
- [ ] Complete test coverage for transaction components
- [ ] Add support for signature collection with various wallet providers
- [ ] Enhance UI for signature thresholds > 3
- [ ] Add email notifications for pending signatures

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- If transaction status is not updating, check the polling interval
- For MultiSig transactions, ensure the wallet owners are correctly set up
- If error messages are not user-friendly, map additional error codes in ErrorDisplay

### MultiSig Testing

For testing MultiSig functionality without deploying contracts:
1. Use the mock data in the MultiSigWalletManager
2. Test signature collection with the confirmTransaction method
3. Verify threshold calculation is working correctly

# Wallet Connection System

This directory contains the wallet connection components for the application.

## Setup WalletConnect

WalletConnect is a protocol that enables wallet connections via QR code, allowing users to connect their mobile wallets to the application.

### Prerequisites

1. You need a WalletConnect Project ID from [WalletConnect Cloud](https://cloud.walletconnect.com/)
2. Create an account and create a new project
3. Copy the Project ID

### Configuration

1. Add the WalletConnect Project ID to your environment variables in the `.env` file:

```
VITE_WALLET_CONNECT_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id_here
```

2. Restart the application for the changes to take effect

### Troubleshooting WalletConnect

If users are having trouble using WalletConnect:

1. Check that the VITE_WALLET_CONNECT_PROJECT_ID is set correctly in your .env file
2. When using WalletConnect, click the dedicated "Connect" button with the QR code icon
3. Make sure the user is scanning the QR code with a WalletConnect-compatible mobile wallet
4. Check the browser console for any error messages related to WalletConnect
5. If using WalletConnect in an iframe or embedded context, it may not work properly
6. Consider using MetaMask or Browser wallet options if WalletConnect continues to have issues

## Using the Wallet Connect Component

The `WalletConnectButton` component provides a single interface for connecting to various wallets:

1. **Chain Capital Wallet**: Internal institutional wallet (custom implementation)
2. **MetaMask**: Browser extension wallet
3. **WalletConnect**: Connect to mobile wallets via QR code
4. **Browser**: Other browser extension wallets (formerly labeled "Injected")

Usage example:

```jsx
import { WalletConnectButton } from "@/components/wallet/WalletConnect";

const MyComponent = () => {
  const handleConnect = (address) => {
    console.log("Connected wallet address:", address);
    // Handle the connected wallet address
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <WalletConnectButton onConnect={handleConnect} />
    </div>
  );
};
```

## Provider Setup

For global wallet connection state, wrap your application with the `WalletConnectProvider`:

```jsx
import { WalletConnectProvider } from "@/components/wallet/WalletConnect";

const App = () => {
  return (
    <WalletConnectProvider>
      {/* Your application components */}
    </WalletConnectProvider>
  );
};
```
