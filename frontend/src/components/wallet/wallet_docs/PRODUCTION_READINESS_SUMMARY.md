## 🏭 **IMMEDIATE PRODUCTION STEPS**

### **Step 1: Deploy Database Schema (1 day)**
```sql
-- Execute in your Supabase dashboard:
-- File: wallet_infrastructure_enhancements.sql
```
**This creates all required tables for the new features**

### **Step 2: Security Hardening (1-2 weeks)**
**Priority: CRITICAL**

1. **Replace Development Key Vault**
   ```typescript
   // Current: Development keyVaultClient.ts

   ```

2. **Implement Production Security Service**
   ```typescript
   // File created: SecurityService.ts
   // Provides: Real-time risk assessment, compliance monitoring
   // Action: Configure with real sanctions databases and ML models
   ```

3. **Set Up Monitoring**
   ```typescript
   // File created: MonitoringService.ts
   // Provides: Performance tracking, alerting, health checks
   // Action: Configure notification channels (Slack, email, PagerDuty)
   ```

### **Step 3: API Credentials Setup (1 week)**
```env
# Add to production environment:

# For immediate testing (development APIs):
VITE_ZEROX_API_KEY=your_0x_key
VITE_ONEINCH_API_KEY=your_1inch_key

# For production Moonpay (requires business verification):
VITE_MOONPAY_API_KEY=pk_live_your_key
VITE_MOONPAY_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_your_secret

# For production Ripple (requires partnership):
VITE_RIPPLE_API_KEY=your_ripple_key
