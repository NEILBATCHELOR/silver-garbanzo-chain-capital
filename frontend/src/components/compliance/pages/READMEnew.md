# /src/components/compliance/pages â€” READMEnew.md

This folder contains top-level page components for compliance dashboards and views. It is intended for developers building or maintaining high-level compliance pages that aggregate and present operational, investor, issuer, or portal compliance data.

## Structure & Contents
- **Dashboard.tsx**: Main compliance dashboard page, aggregating and displaying compliance metrics, workflows, and summaries for users.
- (Expand as new compliance pages or dashboards are added.)

## Usage
- Import these pages in the main app router or layout to provide access to compliance dashboards and summary views.
- Extend with new pages as additional compliance views or dashboards are required.

## Developer Notes
- Ensure page components are modular, leverage underlying compliance modules, and are well-documented for future expansion.
- Document any new page components or dashboards added here.
