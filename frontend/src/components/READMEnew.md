# `/src/components` â€” READMEnew.md

This folder contains all top-level UI components and feature modules for the application. Each subfolder represents a major domain area or feature, while atomic components and shared utilities are organized for reusability and consistency across the app.

## Key Subfolders

- **activity/**: User and system activity feeds, logs, and notifications.
- **admin/**: Admin dashboards and settings.

## Usage
- Import atomic and shared components from `shared/` or `ui/` for consistency.
- Integrate feature modules (e.g., wallet, captable, projects) in pages and flows as needed.
- Extend subfolders with new domain features as the app grows.

## Developer Notes
- All components follow Radix UI/shadcn/ui conventions for accessibility and design consistency.
- Subfolders are organized by domain for scalability and maintainability.
- Avoid duplication by centralizing atomic components and utilities in `shared/` and `ui/`.
- Keep documentation (`READMEnew.md`) up to date as new features and components are added.
