# CapTable Token Management Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Fixed Token Name Display
- Fixed an issue in `TokenDistributionManager.tsx` and `TokenMintingManager.tsx` where the token name "F" was being displayed instead of the full "FACTORING (MRA)" format
- Added special handling to convert the abbreviated token name to its full version for better readability and consistency with `TokenAllocationTable.tsx`

### 2. Export Button Relocation
- In `TokenDistributionManager.tsx`, removed the duplicated Export button from the top section
- Added the Export button next to the column filter and selector buttons in the table header
- This creates a more consistent UI with other filtering and export options grouped together

## Files Modified
1. `/Users/neilbatchelor/Cursor/1/src/components/captable/TokenDistributionManager.tsx`
2. `/Users/neilbatchelor/Cursor/1/src/components/captable/TokenMintingManager.tsx`

## Implementation Details
- Used a conditional expression to check if `summary.tokenType.toUpperCase() === 'F'` and display "FACTORING (MRA)" instead
- Relocated the Export button to be part of the table controls for better UX
- Export functionality remains unchanged, just relocated for better UI consistency
