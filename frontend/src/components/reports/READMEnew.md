### ReportsDashboard.tsx
- **Purpose:**  
  Central dashboard for visualizing key metrics across projects, investors, and compliance.
- **Features:**  
  - Fetches project and investor data from Supabase via service layer.
  - Calculates and displays:
    - Project status distribution (active, draft, completed, archived)
    - Investor metrics (total investors, average investment, KYC completion)
    - Compliance metrics (approved, pending, failed, and percentages)
  - Renders charts and summary cards using Radix UI/shadcn/ui primitives.
  - Displays compliance alerts (e.g., expiring KYC, failed verification).
  - Provides a button to generate compliance reports.
  - Handles loading and error states with toasts and UI feedback.
- **Dependencies:**  
  - `@/services/project/projectService` for projects
  - `@/services/investor/investors` for investors
  - `@/components/ui` for all UI elements
  - `lucide-react` for icons

## Developer Notes
- Extend the dashboard with new metrics or charts as business needs evolve.
- Ensure all data fetching is secure and paginated for performance.
- All UI follows Radix UI/shadcn/ui conventions for consistency and accessibility.
- Use the provided service layer for all data access; do not query Supabase directly in components.
