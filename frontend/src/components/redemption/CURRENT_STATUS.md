## 🚀 Immediate Next Steps (Phase 1 Completion)

### Step 1: Deploy Database Migration ⏳
**Priority**: URGENT - Required for system functionality  
**Time Estimate**: 15 minutes  

**Actions Required**:
1. **Apply Migration Script**:
   ```bash
   # Method 1: Supabase Dashboard (Recommended)
   # Copy/paste content from: /scripts/redemption-database-migration.sql
   
   # Method 2: Supabase CLI
   supabase db push
   ```

2. **Verify Deployment**:
   ```sql
   SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables 
   WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
   AND table_name LIKE '%settlement%';
   ```

3. **Update TypeScript Types**:
   ```bash
   npx supabase gen types typescript --project-ref YOUR_PROJECT_REF > src/types/core/supabase.ts
   ```

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ 6 new tables created (`redemption_settlements`, `fund_nav_data`, etc.)
- ✅ Sample data inserted successfully
- ✅ RLS policies active
- ✅ Updated TypeScript types generated

### Step 2: Service Integration (2-3 hours)
**Priority**: HIGH - Replace mock data with real operations  

**Files to Update**:
1. **Settlement Service** (`/services/settlementService.ts`)
   - Replace mock responses with actual database queries
   - Implement real settlement workflow
   - Add transaction monitoring

2. **NAV Management** (`/services/navService.ts`)
   - Connect to `fund_nav_data` table
   - Implement validation workflow
   - Add oracle integration stubs

3. **Window Management** (`/services/windowService.ts`)
   - Connect to `redemption_windows` tables
   - Implement window lifecycle management
   - Add pro-rata distribution logic

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ All services return real data from database
- ✅ Settlement workflow functional end-to-end
- ✅ NAV management operational
- ✅ Zero TypeScript compilation errors

### Step 3: Testing & Validation (1-2 hours)
**Priority**: HIGH - Ensure system stability  

**Test Scenarios**:
1. **Settlement Workflow**:
   - Create redemption request
   - Process settlement
   - Monitor status updates
   - Verify completion

2. **Real-time Updates**:
   - Dashboard metrics update live
   - Status changes propagate immediately
   - WebSocket connections stable

3. **Calendar Integration**:
   - Window creation and management
   - NAV integration
   - Interval fund workflows

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ End-to-end redemption workflow functional
- ✅ Real-time updates working consistently
- ✅ Calendar features operational
- ✅ No console errors or warnings
