# /src/components/UserManagement â€” READMEnew.md

This folder contains all UI components, pages, and submodules related to user management, security, roles, permissions, and policy administration. It is organized into subfolders for each major user management domain, supporting granular access control, auditing, and user lifecycle management.

## Structure & Subfolders

- **audit/**: Components and logic for user action logging, audit trails, and compliance auditing.
- **dashboard/**: Admin dashboards for managing users, roles, permissions, and policy assignments.
- **policies/**: UI for viewing, editing, and assigning user-related policies (e.g., access, compliance, KYC/AML).
- **security/**: Security settings, MFA, password management, and related user security controls.
- **users/**: Core user CRUD (create, read, update, delete) UI, profile management, and user detail views.

## Top-Level Files

- `.DS_Store`: System file (should be ignored in version control).
- `README-permissions.md`: (Legacy/alternate) documentation for permission system (refer to this for permission model overview).
- `README.md`: Legacy/alternate readme, superseded by this `READMEnew.md`.

## Usage
- Import components from this folder for any user management, security, or admin workflow.
- For details on a specific area (e.g., audit, dashboard, policies), see the corresponding subfolder and its README if present.

## Developer Notes
- Keep user management logic modular and isolated from core business logic.
- Update this documentation as new user management features or security requirements are added.
- Ensure all sensitive operations (role changes, policy edits) are logged via the audit submodule.
