# Standard Configurations

To implement the detailed functionality for configuring ERC tokens (ERC20, ERC4626, ERC1155, ERC1400, ERC3525, ERC721) as React components, we need to expand on their capabilities to support specific financial products and their associated configurations. Below, Iâ€™ll provide a detailed breakdown of the supported financial products for each ERC standard and enhance the React components with additional functionality to reflect these capabilities. The response includes an updated version of one of the components (ERC20DetailedConfig) as an artifact, demonstrating how to incorporate these enhancements, with guidance on applying similar updates to the others.

### Implementation Guidance

For each component, we can:

1. **Add Product-Specific Fields**: Introduce fields like tokenType, vaultType, etc., to explicitly define the financial product.
2. **Enhance Existing Configurations**: Extend structs (e.g., feeOnTransfer, slots) with product-specific attributes.
3. **Update UI**: Add dropdowns, inputs, or switches in the React components to reflect these configurations.
4. **Handle Updates**: Ensure state updates propagate to parent components via onConfigChange or setTokenForm.

Below is an updated version of ERC20DetailedConfig.tsx as an example, incorporating the enhanced functionality. Similar updates can be applied to the other components based on their respective financial products and configurations.

### Applying to Other Components

- **ERC4626**: Add vaultType, enhance yieldStrategy with specific protocols, and include riskProfile in the state and UI.
- **ERC1155**: Add productCategory and rarityLevel to tokenTypes, and include bundleSupport as a toggle.
- **ERC1400**: Add regulationType, enhance partitions with partitionType, and include dividendPolicy settings.
- **ERC3525**: Add financialInstrument, enhance slots with valueUnits, and include derivativeTerms.
- **ERC721**: Add assetType, enhance mintingMethod with auctionParameters, and include provenanceTracking.

These enhancements ensure the components are robust, flexible, and aligned with the financial products they support, providing a comprehensive configuration experience.

Below is a detailed guide on how to apply similar updates to the ERC token configuration components (ERC4626, ERC1155, ERC1400, ERC3525, ERC721) based on their respective financial products and configurations. Each component is enhanced by adding product-specific fields, updating the UI, and ensuring proper state management, providing a comprehensive and user-friendly configuration experience.

### General Approach for All Components

For each component:

1. **Identify Financial Products**: Determine the financial products each ERC standard supports.
2. **Add Product-Specific Fields**: Introduce new fields to the component's state for product-specific configurations.
3. **Update UI**: Add UI elements like dropdowns, inputs, or switches to configure these fields.
4. **Handle Updates**: Propagate changes to the parent component using callbacks like onConfigChange or setTokenForm.
5. **Maintain Consistency**: Ensure the structure and styling align with the existing design for a cohesive user experience.
