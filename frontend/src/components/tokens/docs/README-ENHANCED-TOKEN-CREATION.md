   - Improved handling of nested objects and arrays
   - Better camelCase to snake_case conversion

2. **Refactored Standard-Specific Handling**
   - Split into dedicated handlers for each token standard
   - Improved error handling and detailed logging

3. **Support for All Token Standards**

   - ERC-1155: Multi-token standard with types
   - ERC-1400: Security tokens with partitions/controllers
   - ERC-3525: Semi-fungible tokens with slots
   - ERC-4626: Tokenized vaults with strategies

4. **Enhanced UI**
   - Detailed success dialog with creation results
   - Option to create another token from success screen

## Technical Notes
