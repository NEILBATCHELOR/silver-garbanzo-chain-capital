# Token Batch Service Fix

## Issue Summary
The Token Batch Service was encountering a linter error:

```
Property 'deletionResults' does not exist on type '{ success: boolean; message: string; results: Record<string, any>; }'.
```

This error occurred in the `deleteTokensBatch` function when trying to access a property that doesn't exist on the object returned by the `deleteToken` function.

## Root Cause
The `deleteToken` function in `tokenService.ts` returns an object with the following structure:

```typescript
{
  success: boolean;
  message: string;
  results: Record<string, any>;
}
```

However, in `tokenBatchService.ts`, the code was trying to access a non-existent `deletionResults` property:

```typescript
results.push({
  index: i,
  id,
  status: 'success',
  deletionResults: result.deletionResults  // This property doesn't exist
});
```

## Solution
Updated the `deleteTokensBatch` function in `tokenBatchService.ts` to use the correct property name:

```typescript
results.push({
  index: i,
  id,
  status: 'success',
  results: result.results  // Using the correct property name
});
```

This change ensures that the batch deletion results correctly include the detailed results from each individual token deletion operation.

## Testing
The fix allows the `deleteTokensBatch` function to properly process and return deletion results without TypeScript errors.

## Future Considerations
1. Consider adding TypeScript interfaces for the return types of service functions to catch these issues at compile time
2. Add unit tests to verify the structure of returned objects from service functions
3. Implement consistent property naming across related functions to avoid confusion
