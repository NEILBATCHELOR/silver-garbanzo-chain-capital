# Token Edit Forms Enhancement

This enhancement updates the token edit forms to properly support all the required fields from their respective database tables, ensuring correct CRUD operations with Supabase.

## Summary of Changes

### 1. Fixed Field Mappings
- Updated all token edit forms to correctly map UI fields to database column names
- Ensured all required fields from database tables are included in the forms
- Added proper type handling for different data types (string, number, boolean, JSON)

### 2. Enhanced Data Transformation
- Added proper transformation between UI representations and database formats
- Improved handling of JSON fields and complex data structures
- Fixed data serialization/deserialization for nested objects

### 3. Improved ERC1155 Token Types Management
- Enhanced the editing interface for ERC1155 token types
- Added support for all required fields in the token types table
- Improved error handling and validation

### 4. Enhanced ERC3525 Slots Management
- Updated the slots management interface for ERC3525 tokens
- Fixed field mappings between UI and database schema
- Added support for proper metadata handling

### 5. Improved ERC4626 Vault Configuration
- Completely restructured the ERC4626 edit form
- Added support for all vault-specific fields (strategy, fee structure, limits)
- Fixed handling of complex JSON configuration for yield strategies

## Token Standard-Specific Improvements

### ERC1155
- Fixed the form to properly handle token types with their respective properties
- Improved the database column mapping for proper CRUD operations
- Added proper validation for required fields
- Enhanced UI organization for better user experience

### ERC3525
- Updated the form to include all semi-fungible token features
- Fixed the slots management interface
- Added proper support for slot enumeration and transferability
- Improved mapping between UI field names and database column names

### ERC4626
- Completely rebuilt the form based on the vault token database schema
- Added proper configuration sections for asset, strategy, fee structure, and limits
- Fixed JSON handling for complex configuration objects
- Improved field validation and organization

## Files Updated
1. `/src/components/tokens/components/ERC1155EditForm.tsx`
2. `/src/components/tokens/components/ERC3525EditForm.tsx`
3. `/src/components/tokens/components/ERC4626EditForm.tsx`

## Database Tables Properly Mapped
- `public.token_erc1155_properties`
- `public.token_erc1155_types`
- `public.token_erc3525_properties`
- `public.token_erc3525_slots`
- `public.token_erc4626_properties`

## Next Steps
1. Complete testing to ensure all database operations work correctly
2. Verify that token card views display the correct metadata for each token standard
3. Add any missing fields or relationships that may be required for specific token standards
4. Consider refactoring common form elements into reusable components to reduce duplication

## Testing Considerations
- Test saving tokens with various configurations
- Ensure proper error handling for invalid input
- Verify data consistency between UI and database
- Check that all form fields map correctly to database columns
