# Schema Integration Report

## Overview

This report summarizes the findings from the integration review of ERC token schemas, mappers, forms, and services. The focus was on ensuring consistent property naming, proper type definitions, and robust error handling across the token system.

## Key Findings

1. **TokenMapperFactory Import Path Issues**:
   - The `tokenBatchService.ts` was importing from the wrong path, causing TypeScript errors
   - Fixed by updating the import path to use `mapperFactory.ts` instead of `tokenMapperService.ts`

2. **ERC-1155 Token Types Inconsistency**:
   - The `tokenTypes` property in the ERC-1155 mappers didn't match the expected interface
   - Fixed by adding proper mapping to transform database records to the UI format

3. **ERC-721 Enumerable Property Issue**:
   - The `enumerable` property in the `ERC721MinMapper` was causing a TypeScript error
   - Fixed by using a proper type assertion and ensuring this property is set on the returned object

4. **ERC-4626 strategyController Property Issue**:
   - The `strategyController` property was not properly type-asserted, causing TypeScript errors
   - Fixed by using proper type assertions to handle this property safely

## Schema Integration

The validation schemas (in `/components/tokens/validation/schemas`) are generally aligned with the updated mapper structure. Key observations:

1. **ERC-20 Schema**:
   - Properly handles both the `allowanceManagement` property that was fixed
   - Schema maintains compatibility with the mapper implementation

2. **ERC-721 Schema**:
   - Includes the `enumerable` property that was fixed in the mapper
   - Schema definition is compatible with our implementation

3. **ERC-1155 Schema**:
   - The token type definition in the schema matches our new mapper implementation
   - The conversion functions properly transform the data as needed

## Form Components Integration

The form components successfully integrate with the updated mappers:

1. **ERC20EditForm**:
   - Uses `allowanceManagement` consistently
   - Properly handles the form state and submission to match the mapper expectations

2. **ERC721EditForm**:
   - Handles the `enumerable` property correctly
   - The attributes implementation is aligned with the mapper

3. **ERC1155EditForm**:
   - Has a complex implementation that works with the updated mappers
   - Token types are correctly processed according to the schema

## Service Integration

The token services have been reviewed and are compatible with our mapper updates:

1. **tokenService.ts**:
   - Uses a flexible approach that can handle both standard-specific and general token properties
   - The property mapping functions correctly process the properties we standardized

2. **tokenBatchService.ts**:
   - Now uses the correct import path for `TokenMapperFactory` and `ConfigMode`
   - The batch operations properly leverage the mapper functionality

## Recommendations for Future Enhancements

1. **Consistency Improvements**:
   - Create a central "schema to form mapping" utility to standardize the conversion process
   - Implement additional type guards to improve runtime safety

2. **Type Safety Enhancements**:
   - Add more explicit TypeScript interface definitions for the form data structures
   - Consider using branded types for better type safety in numeric and address fields

3. **Mapper Simplification**:
   - Refactor the mapper implementations to reduce code duplication
   - Create base mappers that can be extended for each token standard

## Next Steps

1. Complete validation testing with real data to ensure the fixes work in production scenarios
2. Implement the direct mappers for ERC-1400, ERC-3525, and ERC-4626 standards
3. Add comprehensive unit tests for the mapper functionality
4. Create end-to-end tests to validate the entire token creation and editing flow
