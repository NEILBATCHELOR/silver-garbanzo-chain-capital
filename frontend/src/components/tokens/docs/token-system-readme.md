# Token Display System Reconstruction

This document summarizes the reconstruction of the "My Tokens" tab in the Token Builder interface.

## Changes Made

1. Created a new `TokenDisplay` component modeled after the `TokenTemplateDisplay` component:
   - Supports both table and card view modes
   - Displays token information in a consistent format
   - Includes status badge with update functionality
   - Provides action buttons for editing, viewing deployment, and deletion

2. Created a new `TokenListTable` component to wrap the `TokenDisplay` component:
   - Similar to the existing `TokenTemplatesTable` component
   - Provides a consistent interface for token listing

3. Updated both `TokenBuilderContainer.tsx` and `TokenBuilder.tsx` to:
   - Use the new `TokenListTable` component
   - Pass appropriate props for token updating and refreshing
   - Integrate with existing status update functionality

4. Enhanced token status update functionality:
   - Reused existing `updateTokenStatus` service function
   - Added status dialog integrated with Supabase backend
   - Ensured token list refreshes after status updates

5. Fixed title to consistently use "My Tokens" throughout the UI

## Benefits

- Consistent UI between My Tokens and My Templates tabs
- Proper token CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- Better error handling and loading states
- Enhanced user experience with tooltips and status updates
- Improved data refresh when operations are performed

## Technical Details

The implementation leverages the existing Supabase backend and token service APIs, ensuring database operations work correctly for all token-related functions.

The architecture follows the established pattern in the application:
- Component files in `src/components/tokens/components/`
- Container components in `src/components/tokens/containers/`
- Table components in `src/components/tokens/table/`
- UI components in `src/components/tokens/ui/`

This approach maintains consistency with the rest of the application and makes future maintenance easier.
