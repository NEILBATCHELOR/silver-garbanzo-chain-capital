# Token Test Utility Fix

## Issue Summary
The Token Test Utility component was encountering an error when attempting to fetch tokens from the database:

```
Failed to fetch token IDs: Error: Failed to get token: JSON object requested, multiple (or no) rows returned
```

This error occurred because the component was using the `getToken(projectId)` function, which is designed to retrieve a single token by ID using the `.single()` Supabase query modifier, but was incorrectly being passed a project ID.

## Solution
1. Updated the TokenTestUtility component to use the correct `getTokensByProject()` function which is specifically designed to get all tokens for a project.
2. Improved error handling to provide more user-friendly error messages.
3. Added proper loading state indicators.
4. Enhanced the UI to guide users when no tokens are available.
5. Reorganized the layout and improved the overall user experience.

## Changes Made

### 1. Correct Function Import
Added import for `getTokensByProject` function.

### 2. API Call Update
Changed the token fetching logic to use the appropriate function:
```typescript
// Previously (incorrect)
const tokens = await getToken(projectId);

// Updated (correct)
const tokens = await getTokensByProject(projectId);
```

### 3. Improved Error Handling
Added better error handling to display meaningful error messages to users and properly manage loading states.

### 4. UI Enhancements
- Added helper component to display guidance when no tokens are available
- Improved form layout and organization
- Added better loading indicators
- Enhanced error and success message displays

## Testing
The component now correctly fetches tokens associated with a project and provides appropriate feedback to users, including:
- Clear error messages
- Loading indicators
- Guidance when no tokens are available
- Proper token selection for read/update/delete operations

## Next Steps
1. Consider adding pagination for projects with many tokens
2. Add token name/symbol to the token selection dropdown instead of only showing IDs
3. Implement sorting and filtering options for token lists
