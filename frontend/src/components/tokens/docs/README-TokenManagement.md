# Token Management System - Hierarchy Support

## Updates and Improvements

This update enhances the token management system to fully support token hierarchies with primary, secondary, and tertiary tokens. The implementation now properly displays all token tiers in the management UI and provides better feedback during token creation.

### Key Features

1. **Token Hierarchy Display**
   - Primary tokens now display badges indicating if they have secondary or tertiary tokens
   - Secondary and tertiary tokens show badges indicating their tier and relationship to primary tokens
   - Token listing shows all tiers of tokens with proper labeling
   - **NEW**: Visual grouping of tokens by tier with section headers
   - **NEW**: Secondary and tertiary tokens are now grouped under their respective primary tokens
   - **NEW**: Tooltips on badges show which primary token a secondary/tertiary token belongs to

2. **Enhanced Token Creation**
   - Progress indicator shows token creation status
   - Step-by-step feedback for each token being created
   - Toast notifications for individual token creation events
   - Improved UI showing when all tokens have been successfully created

3. **Better Data Organization**
   - Clear separation between primary, secondary, and tertiary tokens
   - Metadata properly tracks relationships between tokens
   - Token hierarchy information is preserved and visualized

### Visual Token Grouping

The token management UI now groups tokens by their tier:

1. **Primary Tokens Section**
   - Displays all primary tokens with a blue badge
   - Shows count of primary tokens in section header
   - Primary tokens are listed first

2. **Secondary Tokens Section**
   - Displays all secondary tokens with a purple badge
   - Shows count of secondary tokens in section header
   - Listed after primary tokens

3. **Tertiary Tokens Section**
   - Displays all tertiary tokens with a green badge
   - Shows count of tertiary tokens in section header
   - Listed after secondary tokens

This visual grouping makes it easier to understand token hierarchies at a glance and manage different tiers of tokens.

### Usage

1. **Creating Token Hierarchies**
   - Use the "Create Token" button to open the token creation wizard
   - Add secondary and tertiary tokens as needed
   - Relationships will be automatically maintained

2. **Viewing Token Hierarchies**
   - Primary tokens will show badges indicating their linked secondary/tertiary tokens
   - Use the token details view to see complete hierarchy information
   - Token cards are now grouped by tier for easier management

3. **Refreshing Tokens**
   - Use the refresh button to update the token list
   - The refresh summary shows counts for each token tier

### Technical Implementation

The implementation includes:

1. **Token Tier Identification**
   - Each token in the database has a `tokenTier` field in its metadata
   - Possible values: 'primary', 'secondary', 'tertiary'

2. **Token Relationships**
   - Primary tokens store references to their secondary/tertiary tokens
   - Relationship metadata includes type and direction

3. **UI Enhancements**
   - Token cards and list views now display tier badges
   - Improved creation feedback with progress indicators
   - Detailed toast notifications during creation process
   - Visual grouping of tokens by tier with section headers

### Components Updated

1. **MultiTokenFormContainer**
   - Added progress tracking during token creation
   - Improved UI feedback with progress bar
   - Enhanced toast notifications

2. **TokenDisplay**
   - Added support for token tier badges
   - Updated display logic to show hierarchy information

3. **TokenManagementPage**
   - Fixed token listing to properly identify and display all token tiers
   - Enhanced refresh functionality with tier information
   - Improved token hierarchy extraction from metadata

4. **TokenListCards**
   - Updated to group tokens by tier with section headers
   - Added color-coded tier badges to section headers
   - Displays token counts per tier

### Bugs Fixed

1. Fixed issue where secondary and tertiary tokens were created but not displayed in the token list
2. Fixed missing feedback during token creation process
3. Corrected type errors in TokenManagementPage with configMode
4. Improved token categorization to ensure proper tier assignment
5. Implemented consistent display of virtual tokens from token hierarchies

# Token Management Implementation

This document outlines the implementation of the Token Management page, which displays a list of tokens using the `TokenListCards` component.

## Changes Made

1. **Enhanced TokenManagementPage:**
   - Updated `src/pages/token/TokenManagementPage.tsx` to fetch and display tokens from the database
   - Implemented token management functionality (create, edit, delete, status update)
   - Used the `TokenListCards` component to display tokens in a card view

2. **Added Navigation Link:**
   - Updated `src/components/captable/CapTableNavigation.tsx` to include a "Token Management" link after the "Token Builder" link
   - Used appropriate icon for the menu item

3. **Service Integration:**
   - Added `getTokensByProjectId` function to `src/services/token/getTokens.ts` for API consistency
   - Leveraged existing Supabase data fetching to display tokens

## Features

The Token Management page provides the following features:

- Display tokens in a card layout with key information
- Create new tokens via the "Create Token" button
- Edit existing tokens
- Delete tokens with confirmation
- Update token status (Draft, Review, Approved, Deployed, etc.)
- View token details
- Empty state display when no tokens exist

## Routes

The application already had the following routes set up for token management:

- `/projects/:projectId/token-management` - Token Management page (list view)
- `/projects/:projectId/token-management/new` - Create new token
- `/projects/:projectId/token-management/:tokenId` - View token details
- `/projects/:projectId/token-management/:tokenId/edit` - Edit token
- `/projects/:projectId/token-management/:tokenId/versions` - View token versions
- `/projects/:projectId/token-management/:tokenId/preview-code` - Preview token contract code

## Database Integration

The implementation retrieves tokens from the `tokens` table in the Supabase database, which has the following structure:

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS "public"."tokens" (
    "id" "uuid" DEFAULT "gen_random_uuid"() NOT NULL,
    "project_id" "uuid" NOT NULL,
    "name" "text" NOT NULL,
    "symbol" "text" NOT NULL,
    "decimals" integer DEFAULT 18 NOT NULL,
    "standard" "text" NOT NULL,
    "blocks" "jsonb" NOT NULL,
    "metadata" "jsonb",
    "status" "text" DEFAULT 'DRAFT'::"text" NOT NULL,
    "reviewers" "text"[] DEFAULT '{}'::"text"[],
    "approvals" "text"[] DEFAULT '{}'::"text"[],
    "contract_preview" "text",
    "created_at" timestamp with time zone DEFAULT "now"(),
    "updated_at" timestamp with time zone DEFAULT "now"(),
    "total_supply" "text"
)
```

## Future Enhancements

Potential future enhancements to the Token Management section:

1. Add filtering and sorting options
2. Implement batch operations (bulk delete, status update)
3. Add search functionality
4. Add advanced metrics and analytics
5. Implement token version comparison view
