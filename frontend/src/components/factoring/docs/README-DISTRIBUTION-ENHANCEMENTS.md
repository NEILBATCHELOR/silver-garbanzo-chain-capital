# Factoring Distribution Enhancements

## Changes Made

1. Updated all components in the Factoring module to use the enhanced two-way sorting data table:
   - `PoolManager.tsx`
   - `TokenizationManager.tsx`
   - `TokenDistributionManager.tsx`

2. Fixed discount rate formatting to consistently show 4 decimal places throughout:
   - Updated all discount rate displays in TokenDistributionManager
   - Fixed token allocation form to display discount with 4 decimal places
   - Updated TokenizationManager to display discount rates with 4 decimal places

3. Fixed type errors in TokenDistributionManager:
   - Added proper typing for badge variants
   - Fixed distribution status comparisons using type assertions
   - Ensured consistent handling of editable cells

4. Enhanced investment display in the token allocation form:
   - Improved layout with better visual organization
   - Added clearer labels for token and investment information
   - Fixed formatting for currency and percentage values

## Two-Way Sorting Implementation

The implementation leverages TanStack Table's sorting capabilities with an improved user interface:

1. Added a `SortableColumnHeader` component that renders a dropdown menu with sorting options:
   - Sort Ascending
   - Sort Descending
   - Clear Sorting
   - Hide Column (when applicable)

2. Visual indicators show the current sort state:
   - Arrow Up (↑) for ascending sort
   - Arrow Down (↓) for descending sort
   - Double Arrows (⇅) for unsorted columns

3. All tables in the factoring module now use consistent column definitions with proper sorting:
   - Enabled meta properties for column alignment
   - Added proper typing for all column definitions
   - Implemented consistent cell rendering and formatting

## Discount Rate Formatting

All discount rates now display with 4 decimal places for consistency and precision:

1. Updated display in token tables:
   ```typescript
   ({(token.averageDiscountRate * 100).toFixed(4)}% discount)
   ```

2. Updated display in allocation tables:
   ```typescript
   `${(row.original.tokenDetails?.discount_rate || 0).toFixed(4)}%`
   ```

3. Updated investment form:
   ```typescript
   {(allocationFormData.discountRate || 0).toFixed(4)}%
   ```

## Benefits

- Improved user experience with clear visual indicators for sorting
- Consistent and precise display of discount rates throughout the application
- Fixed type safety issues to prevent runtime errors
- Enhanced token allocation form with better organization and clearer information
- More intuitive data tables with direct sorting controls
