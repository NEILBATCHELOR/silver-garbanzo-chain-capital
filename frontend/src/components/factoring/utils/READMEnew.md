# /src/components/factoring/utils â€” READMEnew.md

This folder contains utility functions and supporting logic for the factoring module, focused on performance optimization, audit logging, and form state persistence. It is intended for developers working on factoring features that require efficient data processing, user state management, or audit compliance.

## Structure & Contents
- **auditLogger.ts**: Utilities for logging audit events and actions within factoring workflows.
- **formPersistence.ts**: Functions for persisting and restoring form state across navigation or reloads.
- **performance.ts**: Performance optimization utilities (throttling, debouncing, memoization, chunked processing) to reduce browser violations and improve UI responsiveness.
- **README.md**: (Legacy or additional documentation.)

## Usage
- Use these utilities to optimize factoring workflows, ensure audit compliance, and provide seamless user experiences.
- Integrate performance helpers in high-frequency event handlers and large data operations.
- Use audit logging and form persistence in all critical factoring forms and actions.

## Developer Notes
- Ensure utility logic is modular, DRY, and reusable across factoring modules.
- Document any new utility modules or optimizations added here.
