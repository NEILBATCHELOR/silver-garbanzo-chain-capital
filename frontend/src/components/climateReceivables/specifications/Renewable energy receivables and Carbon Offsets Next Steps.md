Climate Receivables Module Implementation Summary
I've created a comprehensive Climate Receivables module based on the specifications provided. This module extends the factoring functionality to handle renewable energy receivables, carbon offsets, and renewable energy credits (RECs).

Documentation

README.md - Module documentation
/docs/climate-receivables-implementation.md - Implementation summary
/docs/climate-receivables-report.md - Detailed report

Database Schema
The database schema includes tables for:

Energy assets (solar farms, wind turbines)
Production data linked to weather conditions
Receivables from utilities and customers
Financial incentives (tax credits, RECs, subsidies)
Carbon offsets with verification standards
Renewable energy credits with market types
Tokenization pools for investment
Risk assessment factors

Key Features
This module supports:

Energy Asset Management - Track renewable energy sources and their production
Production Variability - Monitor weather-dependent energy output
Financial Incentives - Manage tax credits, RECs, and subsidies
Carbon Offsets - Track carbon credits from various project types
Risk Assessment - Calculate discount rates based on various risk factors
Tokenization - Create and manage investment pools

Next Steps
The foundation is now in place. The next phases involve:

Implementing detailed components for each entity type
Applying the database migration
Building the business logic for risk assessment and cash flow forecasting
Creating forms and data tables for user interaction
Implementing token creation and distribution workflows

The module follows the same structure as the existing factoring module while addressing the unique requirements of renewable energy financing.
