## üöÄ **Key Methods & Usage**

### **Main Risk Calculation**
```typescript
// Initialize automated risk calculation for all receivables
const result = await EnhancedAutomatedRiskCalculationEngine
  .initializeAutomatedCalculation();

// Calculate risk for specific receivable
const riskResult = await EnhancedAutomatedRiskCalculationEngine
  .performRiskCalculation(receivableId, forceRecalculation);

// Run scheduled calculations
const scheduled = await EnhancedAutomatedRiskCalculationEngine
  .runScheduledCalculations();
```

### **Batch Processing**
```typescript
// Process multiple receivables concurrently
const batchResult = await EnhancedAutomatedRiskCalculationEngine
  .performBatchRiskCalculation(receivableIds, maxConcurrency);
```

### **Analytics & Statistics**
```typescript
// Get risk calculation statistics and trends
const stats = await EnhancedAutomatedRiskCalculationEngine
  .getRiskCalculationStatistics(days);
```

## üéõÔ∏è **Configuration Options**

### **Risk Weights**
```typescript
weights: {
  productionRisk: 0.4,  // 40% weight
  creditRisk: 0.4,      // 40% weight  
  policyRisk: 0.2,      // 20% weight
}
```

### **Risk Thresholds**
```typescript
thresholds: {
  low: 30,      // 0-30 = LOW risk
  medium: 70,   // 31-70 = MEDIUM risk
  high: 90,     // 71-90 = HIGH risk
  // 91-100 = CRITICAL risk
}
```

### **Alert Thresholds**
```typescript
alertThresholds: {
  scoreChange: 15,           // Alert if risk score changes by 15+ points
  discountRateChange: 0.005, // Alert if discount rate changes by 0.5%+
  confidenceDrop: 20,        // Alert if confidence drops by 20%+
}
```

## üìä **Risk Assessment Results**

### **Sample Risk Assessment Result**
```typescript
interface EnhancedRiskAssessmentResult {
  receivableId: string;
  calculatedAt: string;
  riskComponents: {
    productionRisk: { score: 25, factors: ["Winter season"], confidence: 0.9 },
    creditRisk: { score: 35, factors: ["Low credit score: 580"], confidence: 0.95 },
    policyRisk: { score: 15, factors: ["Solar ITC step-down"], confidence: 0.8 }
  };
  compositeRisk: { score: 26, level: "LOW", confidence: 0.88 };
  discountRate: { calculated: 0.028, previous: 0.035, change: -0.007 };
  recommendations: ["Standard monitoring protocols are sufficient"];
  alerts: [];
  nextReviewDate: "2025-10-05T10:00:00Z";
}
```
