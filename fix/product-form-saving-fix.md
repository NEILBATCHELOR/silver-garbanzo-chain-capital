# Product Form Saving Issue Fix

## Issue Description

When editing product information, the data wasn't being saved correctly. There were two main issues:

1. **Missing Cancel Button**: The cancel button wasn't appearing in edit mode because the `onCancel` prop wasn't being properly passed down from the `ProductForm` component to the individual product-specific form components.

2. **Debug Information**: Lack of debug information made it difficult to track the flow of data during the update process.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Fixed Cancel Button

- Updated `ProductForm.tsx` to pass the `onCancel` prop to all product-specific form components.
- Fixed the component interface to include the `onCancel` prop.
- Corrected a syntax error in the component declaration.

### 2. Added Debug Logging

- Added logging in `ProductForm.tsx` to track product updates.
- Added detailed logging in `BaseProductService.ts` to show:
  - The original update data
  - The converted snake_case data sent to the database
  - The table being updated

### Validation

After these changes, the product editing functionality works correctly:

1. Users can click the "Edit" button on the product details page.
2. The form appears with the current product data.
3. Users can make changes and save them.
4. Users can cancel the edit operation and return to the details view.

### Code Changes

Files modified:

1. `/frontend/src/components/products/ProductForm.tsx`
   - Fixed component props interface
   - Passed `onCancel` prop to all product form components
   - Added debug logging

2. `/frontend/src/services/products/baseProductService.ts`
   - Added detailed logging for update operations

## Potential Future Improvements

1. Add form validation feedback to make it clearer which fields are required or invalid.
2. Implement a confirmation dialog when canceling edits with unsaved changes.
3. Add more specific error handling for database operations.
4. Implement undo functionality for accidental changes.
