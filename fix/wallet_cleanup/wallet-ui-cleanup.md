# Wallet UI Cleanup - Sidebar and Transfer Tab Updates

## Overview
Completed cleanup of wallet interface by removing redundant navigation and buttons to streamline user experience.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Transfer Assets from Sidebar
- **File**: `/src/components/layout/Sidebar.tsx`
- **Change**: Removed "Transfer Assets" item from WALLET MANAGEMENT section
- **Rationale**: Transfer functionality is now exclusively available via Wallet Dashboard tabs

**Updated WALLET MANAGEMENT Section:**
```
WALLET MANAGEMENT
├── Wallet Dashboard    ← Main entry point for all wallet functions
├── New Wallet         ← Direct wallet creation 
└── DFNS Custody       ← Institutional custody
```

### 2. Removed Create/Connect Wallet Buttons from Transfer Tab
- **File**: `/src/components/wallet/components/dashboard/TransferTab.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Removed "Create Wallet" button from no-wallets state
  - Removed "Connect Wallet" button from no-wallets state
  - Updated message to direct users to Wallets tab

**Before:**
```
No wallets found
You need to create or connect a wallet before you can transfer assets
[Create Wallet] [Connect Wallet]
```

**After:**
```
No wallets found
You need to create a wallet in the Wallets tab before you can transfer assets
```

## User Flow Improvements

### Simplified Navigation
1. **Primary Path**: Sidebar → Wallet Dashboard → Transfer Tab
2. **Wallet Creation**: Sidebar → New Wallet OR Wallet Dashboard → Wallets Tab → Create
3. **No Duplicate Entries**: Transfer Assets removed from sidebar to prevent confusion

### Clear User Journey
```
User wants to transfer assets:
├── Goes to Wallet Dashboard (sidebar)
├── Sees Transfer tab (2nd position)
├── If no wallets: directed to Wallets tab
└── Creates wallet via Wallets tab interface
```

## Benefits

### **User Experience**
- **Single Source of Truth**: Transfer only accessible via dashboard
- **Cleaner Interface**: No redundant Create/Connect buttons in Transfer tab
- **Logical Flow**: Users naturally progress through Wallets → Transfer tabs
- **Reduced Confusion**: Clear path for wallet creation

### **Technical Benefits**
- **Consistent State Management**: Transfer tab uses dashboard's wallet context
- **Simplified Routing**: No standalone transfer routes
