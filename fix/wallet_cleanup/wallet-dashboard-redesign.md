# Wallet Dashboard Redesign - Completed

## Task Summary
Updated the wallet/dashboard wallets tab to match the GuardianTestPageRedesigned.tsx reference design by removing unnecessary stats cards and ensuring the table structure is identical.

## Changes Made

### 1. WalletDashboardPage.tsx
**File:** `/Users/neilbatchelor/Cursor/Chain Capital Production/src/pages/wallet/WalletDashboardPage.tsx`

**Changes:**
- **Removed:** "Active Wallets" stats card showing standard and Guardian wallet counts
- **Removed:** "Pending Operations" stats card showing Guardian wallets processing status  
- **Kept:** "Total Balance" stats card (only remaining card)
- **Updated:** Grid layout from `md:grid-cols-3` to `md:grid-cols-1` to accommodate single card

**Before:** 3 stats cards (Total Balance, Active Wallets, Pending Operations)
**After:** 1 stats card (Total Balance only)

### 2. GuardianWalletList.tsx  
**File:** `/Users/neilbatchelor/Cursor/Chain Capital Production/src/components/wallet/components/guardian/GuardianWalletList.tsx`

**Changes:**
- **Removed:** Complete wallet stats section containing:
  - "Active Wallets" card (showing active Guardian wallets count)
  - "Pending Wallets" card (showing pending Guardian wallets count)  
  - "Total Accounts" card (showing total accounts across all wallets)
- **Replaced:** Stats section with simple comment placeholder
- **Preserved:** All existing table functionality and structure

**Before:** Stats cards + table
**After:** Table only (matching reference design)

## Reference Design Match

The updated design now exactly matches the GuardianTestPageRedesigned.tsx reference:

### Table Structure (Identical)
- **Guardian ID** - Wallet identifier (truncated)
- **External ID** - External reference (truncated or N/A)
- **Status** - Badge showing wallet status (active, pending, etc.)
- **Accounts** - Count and type badges
- **Primary Address** - Formatted address (truncated)
- **Actions** - Eye icon for view details

### View Details Functionality (Identical)
- Eye icon button opens dialog with wallet details
- JSON formatted details display in scrollable pre-formatted text
- Clean dialog layout matching reference

## Impact

✅ **Cleaner Interface:** Removed redundant stats that were duplicating information
✅ **Consistent Design:** Wallets tab now matches the reference design exactly  
✅ **Better Focus:** Users can focus on the wallet table without distracting stats
✅ **Preserved Functionality:** All existing features remain intact

## Files Modified

1. `/Users/neilbatchelor/Cursor/Chain Capital Production/src/pages/wallet/WalletDashboardPage.tsx`
   - Removed 2 of 3 stats cards
   - Updated grid layout

2. `/Users/neilbatchelor/Cursor/Chain Capital Production/src/components/wallet/components/guardian/GuardianWalletList.tsx`
   - Removed entire wallet stats section
   - Preserved table and functionality

## Status: ✅ COMPLETED

The wallet dashboard wallets tab now has the exact same structure and behavior as the reference GuardianTestPageRedesigned.tsx page, with no "Active Wallets," "Pending Wallets," or "Total Accounts" stats cards, showing only the clean wallet table as requested.
