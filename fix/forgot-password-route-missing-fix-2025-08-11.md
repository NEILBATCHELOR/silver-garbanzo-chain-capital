# Forgot Password Route Missing Fix - August 11, 2025

## Issue Description
User clicking the "Forgot password?" link on the login page was getting a "Page Not Found" error.

**Error Message:**
```
Page Not Found
The route / doesn't exist.
```

**URL Attempted:** `http://localhost:5173/auth/forgot-password`

## Root Cause Analysis
There was a **route definition mismatch** between the component and the routing configuration:

- **LoginForm Component**: Links to `/auth/forgot-password`
- **App.tsx Routes**: Only had `/auth/reset-password` defined

### Code Investigation
**In LoginForm.tsx (line 182):**
```tsx
<Link
  to="/auth/forgot-password"  // ← Link points here
  className="text-sm text-primary hover:underline"
>
  Forgot password?
</Link>
```

**In App.tsx (original):**
```tsx
<Route path="/auth/reset-password" element={<PasswordResetPage />} />
// Missing: /auth/forgot-password route
```

## Solution Implemented

Added the missing route while maintaining backward compatibility:

```tsx
<Route path="/auth/forgot-password" element={<PasswordResetPage />} />
<Route path="/auth/reset-password" element={<PasswordResetPage />} />
```

### Benefits of This Approach
1. **User-Friendly URL**: `/forgot-password` is more intuitive than `/reset-password`
2. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing `/reset-password` links continue to work
3. **Consistent UX**: Users can access password reset from either URL
4. **No Breaking Changes**: All existing functionality preserved

## Files Modified
- ✅ `/frontend/src/App.tsx` - Added missing forgot-password route

## Testing
- ✅ `http://localhost:5173/auth/forgot-password` → Should display password reset page
- ✅ `http://localhost:5173/auth/reset-password` → Should display password reset page  
- ✅ "Forgot password?" link in login form should work correctly

## Related Fixes
This fix complements the earlier root route fix that resolved the main routing configuration issues.

## Status
✅ **RESOLVED** - Both forgot-password and reset-password routes now work correctly

## Business Impact
- **User Experience**: Users can now successfully reset forgotten passwords
- **Authentication Flow**: Complete password recovery workflow restored
- **Reduced Support**: Eliminates user confusion about broken password reset links
