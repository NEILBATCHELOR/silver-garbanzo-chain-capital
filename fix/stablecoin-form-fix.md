# Stablecoin Form Submission Fix

## Issue
The "Save Stablecoin Details" button in the stablecoin product form was not working, failing to save the product information.

## Root Causes

Several issues were identified:

1. **Missing onCancel parameter**: The StablecoinProductForm component had the onCancel prop defined in its interface but was not using it in the component parameter list.

2. **Form validation errors**: Potential validation issues with required fields (assetName, assetSymbol, issuer, blockchainNetwork).

3. **Potential form submission issues**: The form might not be properly triggering the handleSubmit function.

## Fixes Implemented

1. **Fixed onCancel prop usage**:
   - Modified the StablecoinProductForm component to include the onCancel prop in the parameter list
   - Added a Cancel button that's conditionally rendered when onCancel is provided

2. **Added debugging for form validation**:
   - Set form mode to 'onSubmit' for explicit validation on submit
   - Added an onError handler to log validation errors
   - Modified the form to use this error handler

3. **Added debugging button**:
   - Added a "Debug Submit" button that:
     - Logs current form values
     - Logs form state (including errors)
     - Manually triggers form submission

4. **Enhanced error handling**:
   - Added comprehensive error handling for the submission process
   - Added detailed logging at each step of the form submission process

## How to Use the Debug Tools

1. When encountering issues with form submission, open the browser console (F12)
2. Click the "Debug Submit" button to see:
   - Current form values
   - Form validation state
   - Any validation errors
3. The logs will show the progression (or failure) of the form submission process

## Next Steps

After identifying the specific issue through these debugging tools:

1. Fill in all required fields (assetName, assetSymbol, issuer, blockchainNetwork) to satisfy validation
2. Check for any console errors when submitting the form
3. If validation errors persist, adjust the form schema or add more detailed field-level error messages
4. If needed, modify the submission handling process based on the error logs

Once the issue is resolved, the "Debug Submit" button can be removed from the component.
