# TypeScript Error Fix: deploymentWallet Property

## Issue
**File:** `/frontend/src/components/tokens/components/TokenDeploymentFormProjectWalletIntegrated.tsx`
**Error:** `Object literal may only specify known properties, and 'deploymentWallet' does not exist in type 'UnifiedDeploymentOptions'`
**Line:** 329
**Code:** `2353`

## Root Cause
The code was attempting to pass a `deploymentWallet` property to the `unifiedTokenDeploymentService.deployToken()` method through the options parameter, but this property doesn't exist in the `UnifiedDeploymentOptions` interface.

```typescript
// ❌ This was causing the error:
{
  useOptimization: true,
  forceStrategy: deploymentStrategy,
  enableAnalytics: true,
  deploymentWallet: {  // <-- This property doesn't exist
    address: walletAddress,
    privateKey: walletPrivateKey,
    network: blockchain
  }
}
```

## Solution
Removed the `deploymentWallet` property from the options object, as wallet information is handled internally by the deployment services through database storage.

```typescript
// ✅ Fixed:
{
  useOptimization: true,
  forceStrategy: deploymentStrategy,
  enableAnalytics: true
}
```

## Technical Details
- The `UnifiedDeploymentOptions` interface only supports: `useOptimization`, `forceStrategy`, and `enableAnalytics`
- Wallet information is managed by the `TokenProjectWalletIntegrationService` and stored in the database
- Deployment services retrieve wallet information internally rather than receiving it through parameters
- The wallet integration happens earlier in the component lifecycle through the `loadWalletForNetwork()` method

## Architecture Notes
This follows the project's architecture where:
1. `TokenProjectWalletIntegrationService` handles wallet creation/retrieval
2. Wallet information is persisted in the database
3. Deployment services access wallet information through database queries
4. No sensitive wallet data is passed through function parameters

## Files Modified
- `/frontend/src/components/tokens/components/TokenDeploymentFormProjectWalletIntegrated.tsx` - Removed invalid `deploymentWallet` property

## Verification
The component now passes only valid properties to `UnifiedDeploymentOptions`, resolving the TypeScript compilation error while maintaining the intended wallet integration functionality.
