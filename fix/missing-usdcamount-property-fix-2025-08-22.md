# Fix: Missing usdcAmount Property in CreateRedemptionRequestInput - August 22, 2025

## Issue

TypeScript compilation error in `EnhancedRedemptionRequestForm.tsx`:

```
Property 'usdcAmount' is missing in type '{ tokenAmount: number; tokenType: string; redemptionType: "standard" | "interval"; sourceWallet: string; destinationWallet: string; sourceWalletAddress: string; destinationWalletAddress: string; ... 4 more ...; notes: string; }' but required in type 'CreateRedemptionRequestInput'.
```

## Root Cause

The `CreateRedemptionRequestInput` interface requires a `usdcAmount` field, but it was missing from the request data object being constructed in the form submission handler.

## Solution

Added the missing `usdcAmount` property to the request data object with proper calculation:

```typescript
const requestData: CreateRedemptionRequestInput = {
  tokenAmount: formData.amount,
  tokenType: formData.tokenType,
  redemptionType: formData.redemptionType as 'standard' | 'interval',
  sourceWallet: formData.sourceWalletAddress,
  destinationWallet: formData.destinationWalletAddress,
  sourceWalletAddress: formData.sourceWalletAddress,
  destinationWalletAddress: formData.destinationWalletAddress,
  conversionRate: 1,
  usdcAmount: formData.amount * 1, // ✅ Added: Calculate USDC amount
  investorName: '',
  investorId: investorId,
  projectId: projectId,
  notes: formData.notes
};
```

## Implementation Details

- **usdcAmount Calculation**: Set to `formData.amount * conversionRate` (currently `formData.amount * 1`)
- **Future Enhancement**: This calculation can be updated when dynamic conversion rates are implemented
- **Type Safety**: Ensures all required properties are present in the interface

## Files Modified

- `/frontend/src/components/redemption/requests/EnhancedRedemptionRequestForm.tsx`

## Result

✅ **TypeScript Error Resolved**: Property `usdcAmount` is now included in the request object  
✅ **Type Safety Maintained**: All required interface properties are satisfied  
✅ **Functionality Preserved**: Form submission logic works correctly with USDC amount calculation

## Status

**COMPLETED** - The missing `usdcAmount` property error has been fixed and the form now properly constructs the complete `CreateRedemptionRequestInput` object.
