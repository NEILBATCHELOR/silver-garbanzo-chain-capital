# AppKit Error Fix

## Issue Description
After fixing the WagmiProvider error, a new error occurred: "Please call 'createAppKit' before using 'useAppKit' hook". This was caused by the ConnectWalletButton component trying to use AppKit functionality when AppKit was disabled during the "clean build" process.

## Root Cause
- ConnectWalletButton.tsx uses `useAppKit` hook from @reown/appkit/react
- AppKit was disabled/not initialized during clean build
- Component tried to use AppKit functionality without proper initialization

## Solution
Created safe wrapper components that work without AppKit:

### Files Created:
1. `/src/components/wallet/SafeConnectWalletButton.tsx` - Safe wallet button components
2. `/src/components/wallet/index.ts` - Export safe components

### Files Modified:
1. `/src/pages/wallet/WalletDashboardPage.tsx` - Updated to use safe components

## Technical Details

### SafeConnectWalletButton Features:
- Uses wagmi hooks (useAccount, useDisconnect) which work with MinimalWagmiProvider
- Checks if AppKit is available via environment variables
- Falls back to disabled state when AppKit not available
- Maintains same interface as original ConnectWalletButton
- Shows appropriate icons and text based on availability

### Safe Components:
```typescript
- SafeConnectWalletButton: Basic connect/disconnect without AppKit
- SafeWalletAccount: Shows wallet address when connected
- SafeNetworkSelector: Disabled when AppKit unavailable
```

## Implementation:
```typescript
// WalletDashboardPage.tsx
import { SafeConnectWalletButton, SafeWalletAccount } from "@/components/wallet/SafeConnectWalletButton";

// Usage
{isConnected ? <SafeWalletAccount /> : <SafeConnectWalletButton />}
```

## Status
âœ… **COMPLETED** - AppKit error resolved with safe fallback components

## Benefits
- App loads without errors when AppKit disabled
- Wagmi functionality still works (wallet state detection)
- Easy to switch back to full AppKit when re-enabled
- Graceful degradation of wallet functionality

## Files Changed Summary:
- **Created**: `src/components/wallet/SafeConnectWalletButton.tsx`
- **Created**: `src/components/wallet/index.ts`
- **Modified**: `src/pages/wallet/WalletDashboardPage.tsx`

## Testing
The fix provides safe wallet components that:
- Don't throw AppKit errors
- Use wagmi hooks successfully (with MinimalWagmiProvider)
- Show appropriate UI states (disabled when AppKit unavailable)
- Allow wallet disconnection if already connected via other means
