# Active Wallets Metric Update - Processing Status Fix

## Issue Fixed
The Active Wallets metric was not correctly counting Guardian wallets once they were processed. Previously, only wallets with `status === 'active'` were counted as active, but wallets with `status === 'processed'` or `status === 'completed'` should also be considered active.

## Changes Made

### 1. **Updated Active Wallet Classification ✅**

#### **Before:**
```typescript
// Only counted 'active' status
wallets.filter(w => w.guardianMetadata?.status === 'active').length
```

#### **After:**
```typescript
// Now counts 'active', 'processed', and 'completed' as active
wallets.filter(w => 
  ['active', 'processed', 'completed'].includes(w.guardianMetadata?.status || '')
).length
```

### 2. **Updated Pending Wallet Classification ✅**

#### **Before:**
```typescript
// Only counted 'pending' status
wallets.filter(w => w.guardianMetadata?.status === 'pending').length
```

#### **After:**
```typescript
// Now counts 'pending' and 'processing' as pending
wallets.filter(w => 
  ['pending', 'processing'].includes(w.guardianMetadata?.status || '')
).length
```

### 3. **Added Helper Functions for Consistency ✅**

#### **GuardianWalletList.tsx:**
```typescript
// Helper functions for wallet status classification
const isActiveWallet = (wallet: any) => {
  return ['active', 'processed', 'completed'].includes(wallet.guardianMetadata?.status || '');
};

const isPendingWallet = (wallet: any) => {
  return ['pending', 'processing'].includes(wallet.guardianMetadata?.status || '');
};
```

#### **WalletDashboardPage.tsx:**
```typescript
// Helper functions for wallet status classification
const isActiveGuardianWallet = (wallet: any) => {
  return ['active', 'processed', 'completed'].includes(wallet.guardianMetadata?.status || '');
};

const isPendingGuardianWallet = (wallet: any) => {
  return ['pending', 'processing'].includes(wallet.guardianMetadata?.status || '');
};
```

### 4. **Updated Metric Calculations**

#### **Active Wallets Card:**
```typescript
// WalletDashboardPage.tsx
<div className="text-2xl font-bold">
  {wallets.length + guardianWallets.filter(isActiveGuardianWallet).length}
</div>
<p className="text-xs text-muted-foreground">
  {guardianWallets.filter(isActiveGuardianWallet).length} Guardian, {wallets.length} Standard
</p>

// GuardianWalletList.tsx
<p className="text-xl font-bold">
  {wallets.filter(isActiveWallet).length}
</p>
```

#### **Pending Operations Card:**
```typescript
// WalletDashboardPage.tsx
<div className="text-2xl font-bold">
  {guardianWallets.filter(isPendingGuardianWallet).length}
</div>

// GuardianWalletList.tsx
<p className="text-xl font-bold">
  {wallets.filter(isPendingWallet).length}
</p>
```

## Status Definitions

### **Active Statuses:**
- `'active'` - Wallet is fully active and operational
- `'processed'` - Wallet has been processed and is ready for use
- `'completed'` - Wallet creation/setup has been completed

### **Pending Statuses:**
- `'pending'` - Wallet is awaiting processing
- `'processing'` - Wallet is currently being processed

### **Other Statuses:**
- `'failed'` - Wallet creation/processing failed
- `'error'` - Error occurred during wallet operations

## Impact

### **Before Fix:**
- ❌ Processed wallets were not counted as active
- ❌ Users saw lower active wallet counts than reality
- ❌ Inconsistent status interpretation

### **After Fix:**
- ✅ Processed wallets correctly counted as active
- ✅ Accurate active wallet metrics
- ✅ Processing wallets correctly shown as pending
- ✅ Consistent status classification across components

## Files Modified

1. **WalletDashboardPage.tsx**
   - Added helper functions for status classification
   - Updated Active Wallets metric calculation
   - Updated Pending Operations metric calculation

2. **GuardianWalletList.tsx**
   - Added helper functions for status classification
   - Updated Active Wallets card calculation
   - Updated Pending Wallets card calculation

## Benefits

### **Accurate Metrics:**
- ✅ **Correct Active Count:** Processed wallets now show as active
- ✅ **Better User Understanding:** Users see accurate wallet status
- ✅ **Improved Clarity:** Clear distinction between active/pending states

### **Maintainable Code:**
- ✅ **Helper Functions:** Centralized status classification logic
- ✅ **Consistency:** Same logic used across all components
- ✅ **Easy Updates:** Status definitions can be updated in one place

### **Better UX:**
- ✅ **Accurate Dashboard:** Users see correct wallet counts
- ✅ **Status Clarity:** Clear indication of wallet operational status
- ✅ **Trust Building:** Accurate metrics build user confidence

## Status: ✅ COMPLETED

Active Wallets metric now correctly includes processed Guardian wallets, providing users with accurate operational wallet counts in the dashboard.
