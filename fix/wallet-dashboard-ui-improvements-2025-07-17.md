- **Icon Integration:** Proper icon placement with gradient badges
- **Responsive Design:** Mobile-first approach with proper breakpoints

## Technical Implementation

### CSS/Styling Updates
```typescript
// Full-width layout implementation
<div className="w-full min-h-screen bg-gradient-to-br from-slate-50 to-blue-50">
  <div className="w-full max-w-none mx-auto p-4 md:p-6">

// Gradient text headers  
<h1 className="text-4xl font-bold bg-gradient-to-r from-purple-600 to-blue-600 bg-clip-text text-transparent">

// Enhanced tab styling
<TabsList className="grid grid-cols-8 w-full h-14 p-1">
```

### Icon System Migration
```typescript
// Before: 
{ code: 'btc', name: 'Bitcoin', symbol: 'â‚¿', icon: 'ðŸŸ ' }

// After:
{ code: 'btc', name: 'Bitcoin', symbol: 'BTC' }
// With custom gradient badge icons
<div className="w-6 h-6 rounded-full bg-gradient-to-br from-orange-400 to-orange-600 flex items-center justify-center text-white text-xs font-bold">
  {crypto.symbol.charAt(0)}
</div>
```

## Performance Considerations

- Optimized responsive design with CSS grid and flexbox
- Reduced bundle size by removing emoji dependencies

## Accessibility Improvements
- Replaced emojis with semantic Lucide icons for better screen reader support
- Improved color contrast with gradient text and proper background colors
- Added proper ARIA labels and semantic HTML structure
- Enhanced keyboard navigation with proper focus states

## Browser Compatibility
- Removed emoji dependencies that can render inconsistently across browsers
- Implemented CSS gradients with proper fallbacks
- Used modern CSS Grid with flexbox fallbacks for older browsers
