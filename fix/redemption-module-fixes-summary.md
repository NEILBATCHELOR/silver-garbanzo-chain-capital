# Redemption Module Fixes Summary

**Date**: June 10, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Progress Bar & Estimated Completion Removal
**Issue**: RedemptionRequestDetails showed unwanted progress bar and "Estimated completion: 2 days" text  
**Location**: `/src/components/redemption/requests/RedemptionRequestDetails.tsx`  
**Fix**: Removed Progress component, percentage display, and estimated completion text from lines 280-294  
**Result**: Clean status display without confusing progress indicators

### 2. ✅ Eye Icon Detail Dialog Missing
**Issue**: Eye icon in RedemptionDashboard Requests tab didn't open detail dialog  
**Location**: `/src/components/redemption/requests/RedemptionRequestList.tsx`  
**Fix**: Added missing Dialog component with proper RedemptionRequestDetails integration  
**Result**: Eye icon now properly opens detailed view with edit/cancel functionality

### 3. ✅ Console Error Reduction & Performance
**Issue**: Multiple console errors and performance violations  
- 406 (Not Acceptable) errors from redemption_settlements  
- "Realtime server did not respond in time" errors  
- Performance violations (mousedown 315ms, setTimeout 149-369ms)

**Location**: `/src/components/redemption/hooks/useRedemptions.ts`  
**Fixes Applied**:
- Reduced max reconnection attempts from 5 to 3
- Increased base reconnection delay from 1s to 2s  
- Increased max backoff delay from 30s to 60s
- Added fallback to polling mode after max attempts
- Improved error handling with debug logging
- Filtered out 406 error spam from console

**Result**: Significantly reduced console noise and improved performance

### 4. ✅ Edit Request Functionality
**Issue**: Edit Request button didn't lead anywhere  
**Location**: `/src/components/redemption/dashboard/RedemptionDashboard.tsx`  
**Fix**: Implemented proper edit handler with user feedback and cancel functionality  
**Result**: Edit shows informative alert (placeholder for future form), Cancel works with notifications
