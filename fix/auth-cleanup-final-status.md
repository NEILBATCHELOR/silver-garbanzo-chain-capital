### ⚠️ PARTIALLY COMPLETED

**Auth Cleanup Button Removal:**
- Extensive codebase search conducted
- No explicit "Auth Cleanup" button found in current code
- Searched components: AdminUserManagement, AdminUtilityModal, debug components
- Button may already be removed or named differently

## 🚀 IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

To complete the user removal, execute one of these options:

### Option 1: JavaScript Script (Recommended)
```bash
cd /Users/neilbatchelor/Cursor/Chain Capital Production-build-progress/scripts/auth
node remove-user.mjs
```

### Option 2: SQL Script in Supabase Console
1. Open Supabase SQL Editor
2. Copy contents of `remove-user-sql.sql`
3. Execute with service role privileges

**Note:** MCP database connection is read-only, so direct deletion through this interface is not possible.

## 🔍 Auth Cleanup Button - Next Steps

If the auth cleanup button still exists:
1. Provide screenshot or location details
2. Describe button functionality
3. Share component name or page location

Current search suggests the button may already be removed or is part of a dynamically loaded component not visible in the static code analysis.
