# Compliance Service TypeScript Errors Fix

## Summary

Fixed critical TypeScript compilation errors in the backend compliance services that were preventing successful builds.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Document Name Field Access Error
**Problem**: `document_name` field not recognized in `issuer_documents` type selection
**Location**: `/backend/src/services/compliance/ComplianceService.ts:163`
**Solution**: Updated Prisma client generation and restored proper field access after schema synchronization

### 2. Investor Documents Table Access Error  
**Problem**: `investor_documents` table not available in Prisma client
**Location**: `/backend/src/services/compliance/DocumentComplianceService.ts:238-239`
**Solution**: 
- Added missing relation field to `investors` model in Prisma schema
- Regenerated Prisma client to include `investor_documents` table
- Updated DocumentComplianceService to properly access `investor_documents`

## Files Modified

### `/backend/prisma/schema.prisma`
- Added `investor_documents` relation field to `investors` model to fix Prisma validation error

### `/backend/src/services/compliance/ComplianceService.ts`
- Fixed `document_name` field access in pending document reviews query
- Updated entity name mapping to use actual document names

### `/backend/src/services/compliance/DocumentComplianceService.ts`
- Updated document retrieval logic to properly handle both `investor_documents` and `issuer_documents` tables
- Fixed entity_id mapping to use correct foreign key fields (`investor_id` vs `issuer_id`)
- Updated document status update logic for both investor and issuer documents

## Technical Details

### Prisma Schema Fix
Added missing relation field to resolve schema validation error:
```prisma
model investors {
  // ... existing fields ...
  investor_documents        investor_documents[]  // Added this line
  // ... other relations ...
}
```

### Database Schema Verification
Confirmed both tables exist in database with correct fields:
- `issuer_documents.document_name` ✅
- `investor_documents.document_name` ✅

### Prisma Client Regeneration
Successfully regenerated Prisma client to sync types with actual database schema:
```bash
npx prisma generate
```

## Validation

- All original TypeScript errors resolved ✅
- Prisma client successfully generated ✅  
- No build-blocking errors remain ✅
- Both investor and issuer document handling properly implemented ✅

## Future Considerations

- Consider creating a document compliance checks table as referenced in TODOs
- Monitor for any additional type mismatches as schema evolves
- Ensure regular Prisma client regeneration after schema changes

## Status: ✅ COMPLETED

All TypeScript errors in compliance services have been successfully resolved. The backend should now compile without the previously reported errors.
