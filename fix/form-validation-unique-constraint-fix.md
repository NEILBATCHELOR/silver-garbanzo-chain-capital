# Form Validation and Unique Constraint Fix

## Overview

This fix addresses two main issues in the financial products forms:

1. Database unique constraint violations when creating multiple products for the same project
2. React controlled component warnings for checkboxes

## Changes Made

### 1. BaseProductService Update

The `BaseProductService.createProduct()` method has been updated to:

- Check if a product already exists for a project before attempting to create a new one
- Update the existing product instead of creating a new one if it exists
- Provide more detailed error handling and logging

### 2. Form Component Fixes

- Fixed checkbox initialization in `AssetBackedProductForm.tsx` to prevent controlled/uncontrolled component warnings
- Improved error handling in `ProductForm.tsx` with more descriptive error messages
- Created a script to automatically fix checkbox initialization across all form components

### 3. Database Changes

- Added explicit unique constraints to all product tables via a migration script
- Added documentation comments to the constraints for clarity

## How to Apply the Fix

### 1. Apply the BaseProductService and Form Component Changes

The changes to `BaseProductService.ts`, `AssetBackedProductForm.tsx`, and `ProductForm.tsx` have already been applied.

### 2. Run the Checkbox Initialization Fix Script

```bash
# Make the script executable
chmod +x scripts/fix-checkbox-initialization.js

# Run the script
node scripts/fix-checkbox-initialization.js
```

This script will automatically fix checkbox initialization in all product form components to prevent the React controlled component warnings.

### 3. Apply the Database Migration

Run the SQL migration script to add explicit unique constraints to all product tables:

```bash
# Using Supabase CLI
supabase db run -f scripts/20250817_add_unique_constraints.sql

# Or directly in Supabase Dashboard
# Copy the contents of scripts/20250817_add_unique_constraints.sql and run it in the SQL Editor
```

## Testing the Fix

1. Create a new project with any product type
2. Add product details and save
3. Edit the product details and save again
4. Try creating another product for the same project - it should update the existing product instead of creating a new one

## Additional Information

- The fix ensures products follow the "one product per project" rule
- Error messages are now more descriptive and user-friendly
- Form validation is improved with proper initialization of all form fields
