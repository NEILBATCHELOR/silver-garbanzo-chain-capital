# Product Lifecycle Management Fixes

## Issues Fixed

This update addresses two issues in the Product Lifecycle Management system:

1. **Duplicate Records**: When adding events from the Timeline view, duplicate records were being created in the database
2. **Manual Actor Field**: The "actor" field required manual entry instead of automatically using the current logged-in user

## Implemented Solutions

### 1. Fixed Duplicate Record Creation

The duplicate records issue was caused by multiple submissions of the same form data. Fixed with a multi-layered approach:

1. **Client-Side Submission Lock**:
   - Added a submission lock in the form component
   - Prevents the same form from being submitted twice
   - Includes proper error handling to avoid permanent locks

2. **Service-Layer Duplicate Detection**:
   - Added duplicate detection in the `createEvent` service method
   - Checks for similar events created within the last 5 seconds
   - Returns the existing event instead of creating a duplicate
   - Uses smart matching to determine if a new event is likely a duplicate

3. **React Component Optimization**:
   - Improved the event handling in the lifecycle manager component
   - Better handling of state updates to prevent UI refresh issues

### 2. Automated User Attribution

For better user tracking and reduced manual entry:
- Modified the form to automatically populate the "actor" field with the current user's name/email
- Made the field read-only (disabled) since it's now automatically populated
- Renamed the field from "Actor" to "User" to better reflect its purpose
- Updated the field description to indicate it's automatically populated

## Files Modified

1. `/frontend/src/components/products/lifecycle/product-lifecycle-manager.tsx`
   - Modified event handling functions to better manage state updates
   - Improved error handling and UI feedback

2. `/frontend/src/components/products/lifecycle/lifecycle-event-form.tsx`
   - Added submission lock mechanism to prevent duplicate form submissions
   - Integrated useAuth hook for automatic user identification
   - Made actor field read-only and pre-populated with current user

3. `/frontend/src/services/products/productLifecycleService.ts`
   - Added duplicate detection logic in the createEvent method
   - Implemented smart matching of similar events within a short time window
   - Added safeguards to ensure duplicates aren't created in the database

## Benefits

- **Improved Data Integrity**: Eliminated duplicate records in the database
- **Better User Experience**: Reduced manual data entry and form-filling
- **Enhanced Traceability**: Event creators are now automatically tracked
- **Consistent User Attribution**: All events now have proper attribution
- **Robust Error Handling**: Better handling of edge cases and race conditions

## Testing

This fix has been tested for:
- Multiple rapid submissions of the same form
- Creating events with very similar data
- Different connection states (real-time connected vs. polling)
- Proper attribution of events to the current user
