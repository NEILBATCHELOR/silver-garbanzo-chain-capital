# EnhancedRedemptionWindowManager Statistics Display Fix

**Date**: August 26, 2025
**Issue**: EnhancedRedemptionWindowManager showing "0 Total Requests" and "0 Processed" despite database having actual data
**Status**: ✅ FIXED

## Problem Analysis

The user reported seeing "0 Total Requests" and "0 Processed" values in the `EnhancedRedemptionWindowManager.tsx` component despite the database containing:
- **3 redemption requests** linked to "MMF Windows" redemption window
- **All 3 requests approved**
- **$9.2M total value** in the redemption_windows statistics

## Root Cause Identified

**Double Mapping Issue**: The component was incorrectly re-mapping already-correct data from the service.

### In enhancedRedemptionService.ts (✅ Correct):
```typescript
total_requests: row.current_requests || 0,
processed_requests: (row.approved_requests || 0) + (row.rejected_requests || 0),
```

### In EnhancedRedemptionWindowManager.tsx (❌ Incorrect):
```typescript
// This was overriding the correct values from the service!
total_requests: (window as any).current_requests || 0,
processed_requests: (window as any).approved_requests || 0,
```

## Solution Applied

### 1. Removed Incorrect Re-mapping
**Before:**
```typescript
// Handle missing database columns with safe defaults and proper type access
total_requests: (window as any).current_requests || 0,
processed_requests: (window as any).approved_requests || 0,
```

**After:**
```typescript
// Use the statistics fields directly from the service (don't re-map)
total_requests: window.total_requests || 0,
processed_requests: window.processed_requests || 0,
total_request_value: window.total_request_value || 0,
```

### 2. Added Debug Logging
- Log raw data from service
- Log mapped data for display
- Log specific statistics for each window

## Database Verification ✅

**Current Window Statistics in Database:**
```sql
SELECT name, current_requests, approved_requests, total_request_value 
FROM redemption_windows WHERE name = 'MMF Windows';
```

**Result:**
- `current_requests: 3`
- `approved_requests: 3` 
- `total_request_value: 9200000.000000000000000000`

## Files Modified

1. **EnhancedRedemptionWindowManager.tsx**
   - Fixed statistics mapping from service data
   - Added comprehensive debug logging
   - Location: `/frontend/src/components/redemption/dashboard/EnhancedRedemptionWindowManager.tsx`

## Testing Steps

### Step 1: Navigate to Redemption Windows
1. Go to `http://localhost:5173/redemption/windows`
2. **Or** from main dashboard: Redemption → Configure Redemption Windows

### Step 2: Check Browser Console
1. Press **F12** → Console tab
2. Look for these debug messages:
```
Raw redemption window data from service: [array with window data]
Mapped redemption windows for display: [processed array]
Window statistics: [{ name: "MMF Windows", total_requests: 3, processed_requests: 3, total_value: 9200000 }]
```

### Step 3: Verify Display
You should now see in the "MMF Windows" card:
- **3** Total Requests (instead of 0)
- **3** Processed (instead of 0) 
- **$9,200,000** Total Value

## Expected Results After Fix

### Activity Section Should Show:
```
Activity
3      Total Requests  
3      Processed
$9,200,000   Total Value
```

### Activity Stats Grid Should Display:
- **3** in blue box labeled "Total Requests"
- **3** in green box labeled "Processed"  
- **$9,200,000** in purple box labeled "Total Value"

## Troubleshooting

### If Still Showing 0 Values:

**Check Console Debug Output:**

#### Scenario 1: Service Not Returning Data
```
Console: "Raw redemption window data from service: []"
```
**Solution:** Check enhancedRedemptionService database connection

#### Scenario 2: Service Returns Data but No Statistics
```
Console: "Window statistics: [{ name: "MMF Windows", total_requests: 0, ... }]" 
```
**Solution:** Run the fixed SQL script to link requests to windows

#### Scenario 3: Type/Mapping Issues
```
Console: "Window statistics: [{ name: "MMF Windows", total_requests: undefined, ... }]"
```
**Solution:** Check TypeScript types and field names in RedemptionWindow interface

## Verification Queries

Run in Supabase SQL Editor to confirm data integrity:

```sql
-- Verify window statistics are populated
SELECT 
  name,
  current_requests,
  approved_requests,
  rejected_requests,
  total_request_value
FROM redemption_windows 
WHERE project_id = 'cdc4f92c-8da1-4d80-a917-a94eb8cafaf0';

-- Verify requests are linked to windows
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) as linked_requests,
  redemption_window_id 
FROM redemption_requests 
WHERE redemption_window_id IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY redemption_window_id;
```

## Success Criteria

✅ **EnhancedRedemptionWindowManager displays correct statistics**
- Total Requests: 3 (matches database `current_requests`)
- Processed: 3 (matches database `approved_requests`)  
- Total Value: $9,200,000 (matches database `total_request_value`)

✅ **Debug logging provides visibility into data flow**
- Service data is logged for verification
- Component mapping is transparent
- Statistics calculations are visible

✅ **No more incorrect re-mapping**
- Service provides correct data once
- Component uses service data directly
- No type casting or field overrides

The fix ensures the redemption window statistics accurately reflect the real database values by removing the incorrect double-mapping that was zeroing out the correct statistics from the service layer.
