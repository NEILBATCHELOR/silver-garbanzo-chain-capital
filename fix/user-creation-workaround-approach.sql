-- Alternative Solution: Pre-create public.users to satisfy FK constraint
-- Since we cannot modify the auth trigger, we need to ensure public.users exists
-- before creating the auth user

-- This solution involves modifying the enhanced-user-service.ts to:
-- 1. Generate a UUID for the user first
-- 2. Create the public.users record with that UUID
-- 3. Create the auth.users record with the same UUID
-- 4. The trigger will then find the public.users record and succeed

-- The implementation will be done in the TypeScript service file
-- This approach works around the auth schema restrictions
