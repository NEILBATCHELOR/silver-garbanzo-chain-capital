# Organization Detail Page Property Naming Fix

## Issue
TypeScript compilation errors in OrganizationDetailPage.tsx due to property naming mismatch between snake_case database field names and camelCase TypeScript type definitions.

## Errors Found
21 TypeScript errors (code 2551) related to property names not existing on type 'OrganizationWithDocuments'.

## Root Cause
The component was using snake_case property names from the database schema, but the TypeScript types use camelCase naming convention as per the project's coding standards.

## Properties Fixed
- `legal_name` → `legalName`
- `business_type` → `businessType`
- `registration_number` → `registrationNumber`
- `compliance_status` → `complianceStatus`
- `contact_email` → `contactEmail`
- `contact_phone` → `contactPhone`
- `onboarding_completed` → `onboardingCompleted`

## Files Modified
- `/frontend/src/components/compliance/management/OrganizationDetailPage.tsx`

## Resolution
Updated all property references throughout the component to use camelCase naming convention, maintaining consistency with the project's TypeScript type definitions and coding standards.

## Testing
- ✅ All TypeScript compilation errors resolved
- ✅ Component follows proper camelCase naming convention
- ✅ Maintains functionality while fixing type safety issues

## Status
**COMPLETED** - All 21 TypeScript errors have been resolved.
