# Lifecycle Manager Fix

## Issues Fixed

This update addresses two important issues in the application:

### 1. Supabase Real-time Subscription Error

**Problem:**
The application was encountering an error in the ProductLifecycleManager component:
```
Uncaught TypeError: supabase.from(...).on is not a function
```

This error occurred because the component was trying to use Supabase's real-time subscription functionality, but the current Supabase client setup doesn't properly support this feature.

**Solution:**
- Replaced the real-time subscription mechanism with a polling approach
- Set up an interval to fetch updates every 10 seconds
- Removed the `.on()` method calls that were causing the error
- Ensured proper cleanup of the interval when the component unmounts

This change maintains the auto-refresh functionality without relying on WebSocket subscriptions.

### 2. Error Boundary Navigation

**Problem:**
When encountering an error, the Error Boundary component displayed a "Go to Welcome" button that redirected users to the `/welcome` page, which might not be the most intuitive action for users trying to recover from an error.

**Solution:**
- Changed the button text from "Go to Welcome" to "Go Back"
- Modified the button's onClick behavior to use `window.history.back()` instead of a hardcoded redirect
- This allows users to navigate back to their previous page, providing a more intuitive recovery path

## Affected Files

1. `/frontend/src/components/products/lifecycle/product-lifecycle-manager.tsx`
2. `/frontend/src/components/ui/ErrorBoundary.tsx`

## Future Considerations

If real-time updates are a critical requirement:

1. Consider upgrading the Supabase client library to the latest version that fully supports real-time subscriptions
2. Review the Supabase client initialization to ensure the realtime extension is properly configured
3. Implement proper error handling around subscription operations to fail gracefully
