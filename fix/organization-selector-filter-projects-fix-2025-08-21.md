# Organization Selector Filter Projects Fix

**Date:** August 21, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE  
**Issue:** Build-blocking error and organization dropdown not filtering for organizations with projects  

## Problems Fixed

### 1. Build-Blocking Error
- **Error:** Duplicate variable declaration `userOrgError` in OrganizationContext.tsx line 84
- **Cause:** Two separate queries both declaring the same error variable name
- **Fix:** Removed redundant first query and kept only the necessary query for user organizations

### 2. Organization Filtering Requirements
- **Requirement:** Only show organizations that have active projects in dropdown
- **Requirement:** Default to organization with most projects (not first organization)
- **Requirement:** Make dropdown wider
- **Requirement:** Remove organization descriptions from dropdown

## Implementation Details

### Database Query Enhancement
- Uses `project_organization_assignments` table to filter organizations
- Only includes organizations with `is_active = true` projects
- Counts projects per organization for intelligent default selection

### OrganizationContext.tsx Changes
```typescript
// Old: Two queries with duplicate variable names
const { data: userOrgRoles, error: userOrgError } = await supabase...
const { data: allUserOrgRoles, error: userOrgError } = await supabase... // ❌ Duplicate

// New: Single clean query flow
const { data: allUserOrgRoles, error: userOrgError } = await supabase...
// Then filter for organizations with projects
const { data: orgsWithProjects, error: projectsError } = await supabase...
```

### Smart Default Selection
```typescript
// Count projects per organization
const orgProjectCounts = new Map<string, number>();

// Sort organizations by project count (descending)
.sort((a, b) => b.projectCount - a.projectCount)

// Auto-select organization with most projects
const defaultOrg = organizations[0]; // TechCorp Solutions Inc (13 projects)
```

### UI Improvements
```typescript
// Wider dropdown
<SelectTrigger className={`... w-[400px]`}> // Was w-[280px]

// Only shows organization names (no descriptions)
<SelectItem key={org.id} value={org.id}>
  {org.name}
</SelectItem>
```

## Database Results

### Organizations with Projects
| Organization | Project Count | Shown in Dropdown |
|-------------|---------------|------------------|
| TechCorp Solutions Inc | 13 | ✅ **Default** |
| Metro Real Estate Fund LP | 1 | ✅ |
| Global Ventures Cayman Ltd | 0 | ❌ Filtered out |

### User Access
- Neil (neil.batchelor@btinternet.com): Super Admin access to all organizations
- Neil Operations (neilbatchelor@icloud.com): Operations access to all organizations

## Files Modified

1. **OrganizationContext.tsx**
   - Fixed duplicate variable declaration
   - Enhanced organization filtering logic
   - Added project count sorting for default selection

2. **OrganizationSelector.tsx**  
   - Increased dropdown width from 280px to 400px

## Testing Results

- ✅ TypeScript compilation passes with no errors
- ✅ Organization dropdown only shows organizations with projects
- ✅ Default selection prioritizes organization with most projects
- ✅ Dropdown is wider for better usability
- ✅ No descriptions shown (clean organization names only)

## Status

**✅ PRODUCTION READY**
- All build-blocking errors resolved
- Organization filtering working as requested
- UI improvements implemented
- No breaking changes to existing functionality

The organization selector now intelligently filters and prioritizes organizations based on project activity, providing a better user experience and ensuring only relevant organizations are displayed.
