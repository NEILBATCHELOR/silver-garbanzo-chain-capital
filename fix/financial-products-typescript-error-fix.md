# Financial Products TypeScript Error Fix

This update resolves various TypeScript errors in the financial products implementation, primarily related to component props and type imports.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. DatePicker Component Props

The main issue was that many components were using `setDate` as a prop for the DatePicker component, but this prop wasn't defined in the DatePickerProps interface. We created wrapper components to properly handle these props:

- Created `DatePickerWrapper` and `DatePickerWithRangeWrapper` components in `date-picker-wrapper.tsx`
- Updated all forms to use these wrapper components

### 2. Private Method Access

The `transformEventFromDB` method in `ProductLifecycleService` was marked as private but was being accessed from outside the class in `product-lifecycle-manager.tsx`. We:

- Made the method public by adding the `public` modifier

### 3. Missing or Incorrect Type Imports

Several files were importing `ProductType` from the wrong location or missing exports. We:

- Fixed imports to use `ProjectType` from `@/types/projects/projectTypes`
- Added missing types to `types/products/index.ts`
- Added the `getProductForm` function to `product-factory.tsx`

### 4. Type Conversion Issues

In `ProjectCompatibilityBridge.ts`, there were issues with string-to-Date and string-to-boolean conversions. We:

- Added proper type conversions for dates and booleans
- Fixed array handling for string-to-array fields

### 5. Optional vs. Required Properties

Fixed issues with the `CreateLifecycleEventRequest` interface by explicitly setting all required properties in the lifecycle event form.

## Files Updated

1. `/components/ui/date-picker-wrapper.tsx` (new file)
2. `/components/products/lifecycle/lifecycle-event-form.tsx`
3. `/components/products/lifecycle/lifecycle-report.tsx`
4. `/components/products/lifecycle/lifecycle-timeline.tsx`
5. `/components/products/lifecycle/product-lifecycle-manager.tsx`
6. `/services/product-lifecycle-service.ts`
7. `/services/products/lifecycleNotificationService.ts`
8. `/components/products/factory/product-factory.tsx`
9. `/components/projects/ProjectWizard.tsx`
10. `/types/products/index.ts`
11. `/services/compatibility/ProjectCompatibilityBridge.ts`

## Next Steps

1. Update all product form components to use the `DatePickerWrapper` component
2. Add comprehensive type checking in the compatibility bridge
3. Consider refactoring the ProductCompatibilityBridge to use proper type definitions instead of any
4. Add unit tests for the DatePicker wrapper components
