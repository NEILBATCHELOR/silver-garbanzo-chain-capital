# Database Record Duplication Fix

## Issue Description
Records were being duplicated in screens and in the database, causing data integrity issues.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was traced to the audit wrapper implementation in the Supabase client file. The audit proxy intercepted database operations and was likely creating race conditions or triggering multiple inserts for a single operation due to how it was handling promises and callbacks.

## Fix Implementation
1. Completely removed the audit proxy functionality from the Supabase client
2. Set `AUDIT_PROXY_ENABLED` to `false` to ensure the direct client is used
3. Simplified the client export to bypass any potential proxy implementation
4. Removed the import of `unifiedAuditCoordinator` which was part of the audit system

## Files Modified
- `/frontend/src/infrastructure/database/client.ts`

## Technical Details
The previous implementation used a JavaScript Proxy to intercept database operations (insert, update, upsert, delete) and log them via the audit coordinator. This proxy was wrapping the actual database operations and potentially causing side effects or duplicate operations due to asynchronous promise handling.

The fix removes this layer entirely, ensuring that all database operations directly use the Supabase client without any intermediate proxying or tracking that could cause duplicate operations.

## Verification
To verify this fix works correctly:
1. Check that no duplicate records appear when creating new entities
2. Verify that UI displays show the correct number of records without duplicates
3. Confirm that database operations complete successfully

## Additional Notes
If audit logging is required in the future, consider implementing it using database triggers or a separate event-driven system that doesn't interfere with the primary database operations.
