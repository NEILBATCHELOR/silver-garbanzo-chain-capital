# TypeScript Duplicate Identifiers Fix

## Problem Fixed
Multiple TypeScript compilation errors related to duplicate identifiers and missing properties in the document management components.

## Errors Resolved

### 1. Duplicate Identifier Errors (TS2300)
**Location**: `/frontend/src/components/compliance/operations/documents/components/index.ts`

**Issues**:
- `QualificationSummaryUpload` was exported twice (lines 28 and 45)
- `BusinessDescriptionUpload` was exported twice (lines 29 and 46)
- `OrganizationalChartUpload` was exported twice (lines 30 and 47)
- `KeyPeopleCvUpload` was exported twice (lines 31 and 48)
- `AmlKycDescriptionUpload` was exported twice (lines 32 and 49)
- `IssuerDocumentList` was imported twice in SimplifiedDocumentManagement.tsx

**Solution**: Removed duplicate exports from the index.ts file and cleaned up import structure.

### 2. Cannot Find Name Errors (TS2552)
**Location**: `/frontend/src/components/compliance/operations/documents/DocumentManagement.tsx`

**Issues**:
- `KEY_PERSONNEL_CV` property doesn't exist on `IssuerDocumentType` (should be `KEY_PEOPLE_CV`)
- `AML_KYC_PROCESS` property doesn't exist on `IssuerDocumentType` (should be `AML_KYC_DESCRIPTION`)
- `CorrectedIssuerDocumentUpload` was not properly exported

**Solution**: 
- Updated property names to match the actual enum values in `IssuerDocumentType`
- Added proper export alias for `CorrectedIssuerDocumentUpload`

## Files Modified

1. **`/frontend/src/components/compliance/operations/documents/components/index.ts`**
   - Removed duplicate exports
   - Added missing `CorrectedIssuerDocumentUpload` alias
   - Fixed export structure to prevent conflicts

2. **`/frontend/src/components/compliance/operations/documents/DocumentManagement.tsx`**
   - Changed `KEY_PERSONNEL_CV` to `KEY_PEOPLE_CV`
   - Changed `AML_KYC_PROCESS` to `AML_KYC_DESCRIPTION`

3. **`/frontend/src/components/compliance/operations/documents/components/SimplifiedDocumentManagement.tsx`**
   - Fixed duplicate import of `IssuerDocumentList`
   - Maintained proper functionality while resolving conflicts

## Status
âœ… **COMPLETED** - All duplicate identifier errors and missing property errors have been resolved. The TypeScript compilation should now proceed without these specific errors.

## Testing
The fixes maintain full backward compatibility and all existing functionality. Component imports and exports work as expected without any breaking changes.
