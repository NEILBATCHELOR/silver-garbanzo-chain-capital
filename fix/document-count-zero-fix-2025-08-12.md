# Document Count Zero Fix - August 12, 2025

## Issue Summary
Document counts were showing zero in the compliance management dashboard at `/compliance/management` despite having actual document records in the `issuer_documents` table.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Database Investigation
- **Document Record Found**: 1 document exists in `issuer_documents` table
  - Organization: TechCorp Solutions Inc 
  - Document: Certificate of Incorporation (Cert-6)
  - File URL: Valid Supabase storage URL
  - Status: Active

### Service Logic Issue
The `OrganizationService.getOrganizations()` method was hardcoding `document_count: 0` with the comment:
```typescript
document_count: 0 // Will be updated when organization_id relationship is available
```

### Database Relationship Discovery
Database analysis revealed that the relationship DOES exist:
- `issuer_documents.issuer_id` corresponds to `organizations.id`
- TechCorp Solutions Inc has matching IDs in both tables
- The relationship was functional but the service was ignoring it

## Solution Implemented

### Fixed Methods in OrganizationService.ts

#### 1. getOrganizations() Method
**Before**: Hardcoded `document_count: 0`
**After**: Properly counts documents using `issuer_id` relationship
```typescript
// Count documents where issuer_id matches organization id
const { count, error: countError } = await supabase
  .from('issuer_documents')
  .select('*', { count: 'exact', head: true })
  .eq('issuer_id', org.id);
```

#### 2. getDocumentCount() Method
**Before**: Always returned 0
**After**: Queries `issuer_documents` table with proper filtering

#### 3. getOrganizationDocuments() Method
**Before**: Always returned empty array
**After**: Fetches actual documents for organizations

#### 4. linkDocumentToOrganization() Method
**Before**: Always returned false with warning message
**After**: Properly links documents via `issuer_id` relationship

## Files Modified
