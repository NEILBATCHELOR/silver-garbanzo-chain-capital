# User Creation Foreign Key Constraint Fix

## Problem Summary
Users were experiencing a foreign key constraint violation error when creating new users through the AddUserModal component:

```
Error creating user: {
  code: '23503', 
  details: 'Key (id)=(4e02f0d6-b465-4316-82e2-80e1b708b709) is not present in table "users".', 
  hint: null, 
  message: 'insert or update on table "users" violates foreign key constraint "users_id_fkey"'
}
```

## Root Cause Analysis

**Issue**: Race condition between Supabase auth user creation and public users table insertion.

1. **Foreign Key Constraint**: The `public.users.id` field has a foreign key constraint `users_id_fkey` that references `auth.users.id`
2. **Timing Issue**: `signUp()` creates user in `auth.users` but due to async/transaction processing, the record isn't immediately visible for foreign key validation
3. **Race Condition**: The immediate attempt to insert into `public.users` fails because `auth.users` record isn't committed yet

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added Retry Mechanism with Delays
```typescript
// Wait for auth.users to be fully committed
await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 500));

// Retry mechanism for creating user in public.users
let retries = 3;
while (retries > 0) {
  try {
    const { data, error: profileError } = await supabase
      .from("users")
      .insert({...})
      .single();
      
    if (profileError?.code === '23503' && retries > 1) {
      await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 1000));
      retries--;
      continue;
    }
    // ... handle success/final error
  } catch (error) {
    // ... retry logic
  }
}
```

### 2. Applied Same Fix to Role Assignment
- Added retry mechanism for `user_roles` table insertion
- Handles potential FK constraint violations during role assignment

### 3. Enhanced Error Logging
- Added detailed logging for FK constraint violations
- Includes user email, error codes, and constraint details for debugging

## Files Modified

1. **`/frontend/src/services/auth/authService.ts`**
   - Added retry mechanism with delays in `createUser()` method
   - Enhanced error logging for FK constraint violations
   - Applied same fix to role assignment logic

## Testing

- ✅ User creation now succeeds after FK constraint errors
- ✅ Role assignment handles timing issues
- ✅ Better error reporting for debugging
- ✅ Graceful fallback with multiple retry attempts

## Prevention Measures

1. **Database Design**: Consider if FK constraint from public.users to auth.users is necessary
2. **Transaction Handling**: Future implementations should use proper transaction blocks
3. **Monitoring**: Enhanced logging helps identify similar timing issues

## Notes

- The fix maintains backward compatibility
- Performance impact is minimal (500ms initial delay + up to 3 retries with 1s delays)
- Error handling remains robust with proper exception propagation
