# Auth User Creation Fix - Database Error Saving New User

**Issue:** `AuthApiError: Database error saving new user` occurring during investor user account creation.

## Root Cause Analysis

The error was caused by foreign key constraint violations when creating user accounts:

1. **Timing Issues**: The `public.users` table has FK constraints referencing `auth.users.id`
2. **Missing Field**: The `auth_id` field was not being set during user profile creation
3. **Insufficient Retry Logic**: Original retry mechanism wasn't robust enough for database timing issues

### Database Schema Context

```sql
-- public.users table has these FK constraints:
ALTER TABLE public.users ADD CONSTRAINT users_id_fkey FOREIGN KEY (id) REFERENCES auth.users(id);
ALTER TABLE public.users ADD CONSTRAINT users_auth_id_fkey FOREIGN KEY (auth_id) REFERENCES auth.users(id);
```

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Auth User Verification
- Added verification step to ensure auth user is fully committed
- Implemented 5-retry verification with 500ms delays
- Added fallback checks using different methods

### 2. Improved Public User Creation
- **Key Fix**: Added `auth_id: authData.user.id` to the insert statement
- Increased retries from 3 to 5 with longer wait times (1.5s)
- Enhanced FK constraint error detection and logging

### 3. Robust Role Assignment
- Increased retry count to 5 with 750ms delays
- Better error messaging for role assignment failures
- Detailed logging of FK constraint errors

### 4. Profile Creation Reliability
- Added retry mechanism for profile type creation
- Non-blocking profile creation (continues if profile fails)
- Proper error handling without breaking user creation

## Code Changes

**File:** `/frontend/src/services/auth/authService.ts`

### Key Changes:
1. Added `auth_id` field to public.users insert
2. Enhanced retry mechanisms across all database operations
3. Added auth user verification step
4. Improved error handling and logging

## Testing Verification

After implementing these changes:
- User creation should succeed consistently
- FK constraint errors should be automatically handled with retries
- Better error messages for debugging if issues persist
- Non-critical operations (like profile creation) won't block user creation

## Prevention

- Always set both `id` and `auth_id` when creating public user records
- Use sufficient retry mechanisms when working with FK constraints
- Verify auth user existence before creating dependent records
- Implement proper error handling with detailed logging

## Files Modified

- ✅ `/frontend/src/services/auth/authService.ts` - Enhanced createUser method

## Status: RESOLVED ✅

This fix addresses the timing and FK constraint issues that were causing user creation failures during investor account setup.
