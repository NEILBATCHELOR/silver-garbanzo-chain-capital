# Token System Implementation - FINAL STATUS

## ✅ IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE: 100% ✅

**Date**: June 7, 2025  
**Final Status**: **100% COMPLETE** - All Enhanced Forms Implemented and Integrated!

## 🎉 CRITICAL DISCOVERY: ALL FORMS WERE ALREADY IMPLEMENTED! 

### The Issue: Form Exports, Not Implementation

**What Was Missing**: The enhanced forms were already 100% complete, but the regular form files were exporting placeholders instead of the enhanced versions.

**Root Cause**: Import/Export mismatch - Token pages were importing placeholders instead of the fully-implemented enhanced forms.

### ✅ SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED: Form Export Integration

Updated all regular form files to properly export enhanced versions:

```typescript
// Before (Placeholder):
export default PlaceholderForm;

// After (Enhanced):
export { default } from './enhanced/ERC20EditForm';
```
