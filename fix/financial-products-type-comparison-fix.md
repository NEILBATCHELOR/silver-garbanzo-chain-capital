# Financial Products Type Comparison Fix

## Overview

This fix resolves TypeScript comparison errors in the `ProjectDetailsPage.tsx` file related to comparing string values with ProjectType enum members.

## Issue Description

The following TypeScript errors were occurring in `ProjectDetailsPage.tsx`:

1. "Type 'ProjectType.STRUCTURED_PRODUCTS' is not comparable to type 'ProjectType'."
2. "Type 'ProjectType.BONDS' is not comparable to type 'ProjectType'."
3. "Type 'ProjectType.PRIVATE_EQUITY' is not comparable to type 'ProjectType'."

These errors were occurring in the `renderProductSpecificOverview` function where string values from `project.projectType` were being compared directly with enum members.

## Solution

The issue was fixed by calling `.toString()` on the enum values being compared in the switch statement:

```typescript
switch (project.projectType) {
  case ProjectType.STRUCTURED_PRODUCTS.toString():
    // Implementation...
  case ProjectType.BONDS.toString():
    // Implementation...
  case ProjectType.PRIVATE_EQUITY.toString():
    // Implementation...
  // Other cases...
}
```

This solution ensures that the string value of `project.projectType` is properly compared with the string representation of the enum values.

## Files Modified

## Verification

The TypeScript errors have been resolved, allowing the project to compile without type comparison errors.

## Additional Notes

When comparing string values with enum members in TypeScript, it's important to ensure that the types match properly. In this case, the `project.projectType` property is a string, while the `ProjectType` enum members are enum values. Using `.toString()` on the enum values ensures proper type comparison.

Alternatively, we could have:

1. Changed the type of `project.projectType` to be `ProjectType` instead of a string
2. Used explicit string values in the case statements: `case "structured_products":` 

The chosen solution preserves the use of the enum for better maintainability and type safety, while fixing the immediate error.
