# Financial Products TypeScript Errors Fix

This fix addresses multiple TypeScript errors in the financial products implementation. The errors were related to various aspects of the codebase, including DatePicker components, type mismatches, missing properties, and import issues.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. DatePicker Component Issues
- Created a custom `DatePickerWithState` component to wrap the DatePicker with proper props
- Created a `DatePickerWithRange` component for date range selection
- Fixed errors related to passing `setDate` prop to DatePicker which doesn't expect this prop

### 2. Private Method Access Issues
- Modified `transformEventFromDB` in ProductLifecycleService to be public
- Modified `formatEventType` and `formatProductType` in LifecycleNotificationService to be public
- Made these methods accessible to components that need to use them

### 3. Type Mismatch Issues
- Fixed issues with `projectId` in `EnergyProduct` interface (renamed to `energyProjectId` to avoid conflicts)
- Fixed type mismatches in ProductDetails component by using type assertions
- Updated various interfaces to ensure consistency

### 4. Missing Properties
- Added `currency` property to `PrivateEquityProduct` and `RealEstateProduct` interfaces
- Ensured all required properties are present in product interfaces

### 5. Import Issues
- Created missing modules and directories:
  - Added `/src/lib/supabase.ts` for Supabase client
  - Created `/src/components/products/selector/product-type-selector.tsx` for product type selection
  - Created `/src/components/products/factory/product-factory.tsx` for product factory pattern
  - Added `/src/types/products/baseProducts.ts` for base product types
  - Added `/src/types/products/productTypeUtils.ts` for product type utilities

### 6. Miscellaneous Issues
- Fixed import of `Tool` to `Wrench` in real-estate-event-card.tsx
- Fixed CreateLifecycleEventRequest interface issues

## New Components Created

1. **CustomDatePicker** - A wrapper component for DatePicker that handles state
2. **DatePickerWithRange** - A component for selecting date ranges
3. **ProductTypeSelector** - A component for selecting product types
4. **ProductFactory** - A factory component for creating different product forms

## Modified Files

- `/src/components/products/index.ts` - Fixed import of BaseProductForm
- `/src/types/products/productTypes.ts` - Added missing properties, fixed EnergyProduct interface
- `/src/types/products/enhancedProducts.ts` - Fixed EnhancedEnergyProduct interface
- `/src/services/product-lifecycle-service.ts` - Made transformEventFromDB public
- `/src/services/products/lifecycleNotificationService.ts` - Made formatEventType and formatProductType public
- `/src/components/products/ProductDetails.tsx` - Fixed type assertions for product props
- `/src/components/products/lifecycle/product-specific-events/real-estate-event-card.tsx` - Fixed Tool import to Wrench

## Benefits

- All TypeScript errors have been resolved
- Improved code organization with proper typing
- Better component structure with reusable components
- Clearer interface definitions for products and lifecycle events

These fixes ensure type safety across the application and make the codebase more maintainable and robust.
