# TypeScript Form Field Type Assertions Fix

## Overview

This fix addresses TypeScript errors in the `StablecoinProductForm.tsx` component related to type mismatches, specifically where `unknown` types were being assigned to more specific types like `string`, `boolean`, and others.

## Issues Fixed

The following TypeScript errors were fixed:

1. `Type 'unknown' is not assignable to type 'string'` in Select components' `defaultValue` props
2. `Type 'unknown' is not assignable to type 'string | number | readonly string[]'` in Input and Textarea components' `value` props
3. `Type 'unknown' is not assignable to type 'CheckedState'` in Checkbox components' `checked` props

## Solution

The solution involved adding appropriate type assertions to convert from `unknown` to the expected types:

1. For Select components:
   ```tsx
   defaultValue={field.value as string}
   ```

2. For Input and Textarea components:
   ```tsx
   value={field.value as string || ''}
   ```

3. For Checkbox components:
   ```tsx
   checked={field.value as boolean}
   ```

## Why This Happened

This issue occurred because the form was using React Hook Form with a very permissive schema (`passthrough()`) that allowed for additional properties beyond the strictly defined ones. As a result, many of the form values were typed as `unknown` since their specific types weren't defined in the schema.

## How to Prevent Similar Issues

To avoid similar typing issues in the future:

1. **Define complete schemas**: Ensure your Zod schemas include all fields with their proper types
2. **Use proper type inference**: Use proper type inference when defining form values
3. **Consider strict type checking**: Use TypeScript's strict mode to catch these issues earlier
4. **Validate form fields**: Add validation rules to ensure field values are of the expected type
5. **Add guard clauses**: Where necessary, add runtime checks to ensure values are of the expected type

## Related Components

If you encounter similar type errors in other product form components, you can apply the same fix pattern:

1. Identify the type mismatch
2. Add appropriate type assertions using the `as` keyword
3. Add fallback values for nullable fields (e.g., `value={field.value as string || ''}`)

## Testing

After applying these fixes, the form should:
- Compile without TypeScript errors
- Function correctly for creating and editing stablecoin products
- Properly handle all form field types
