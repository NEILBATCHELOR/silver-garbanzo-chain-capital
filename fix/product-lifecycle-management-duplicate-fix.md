# Product Lifecycle Management Duplicate Entry Fix

## Issues Fixed

This update addresses two major issues in the Product Lifecycle Management system:

1. **Duplicate Database Records**: Events were being created multiple times in the database
2. **Duplicate UI Entries**: Events were appearing twice in the UI, even when there was only one database record
3. **Actor vs User Field**: The "actor" field required manual entry instead of automatically using the current logged-in user

## Root Causes Identified

After thorough investigation, we identified the following root causes:

1. **Database Duplicates**:
   - Race conditions in the form submission process
   - Lack of proper duplicate detection in the service layer
   - Insufficient submission locking mechanisms

2. **UI Duplicates**:
   - Conflicts between manual state updates and real-time subscription updates
   - Lack of deduplication logic in the real-time subscription handler
   - No tracking of which events had already been processed

## Comprehensive Solution

We implemented a multi-layered solution to address all aspects of the problem:

### 1. Form Submission Protection

- **Double-Lock Mechanism**: 
  - Added both state-based lock (`submissionLock`) and ref-based lock (`submissionInProgressRef`)
  - The ref-based approach prevents race conditions between state updates
  - The form remains locked after submission until it's unmounted

- **Proper Cleanup**:
  - Added useEffect cleanup to reset refs when component unmounts
  - Prevents stale refs from affecting future submissions

### 2. Service-Layer Duplicate Detection

- **Enhanced Duplicate Detection**:
  - Increased the lookback window from 5 to 15 seconds
  - Added more robust error handling in the duplicate check
  - Improved logging for better debugging and monitoring

- **Smarter Matching Algorithm**:
  - Added fuzzy matching for numeric values (quantity)
  - Better handling of null/undefined cases
  - More precise matching criteria to catch true duplicates without false positives

### 3. UI Deduplication

- **State Management Improvements**:
  - Added explicit check to prevent adding events that already exist in state
  - Used consistent ID handling across all event types (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
  - Skip subscription updates during form submission

- **Defensive Processing**:
  - Added validation for event IDs before processing
  - Better error handling and logging throughout the subscription handler
  - Fallback to full refresh only when necessary

## Files Modified

1. `/frontend/src/components/products/lifecycle/lifecycle-event-form.tsx`
   - Added useRef for submission tracking
   - Implemented double-lock mechanism with cleanup
   - Automatic user attribution from auth context

2. `/frontend/src/components/products/lifecycle/product-lifecycle-manager.tsx`
   - Enhanced subscription handler with deduplication logic
   - Added check to skip subscription updates during form submission
   - Improved error handling and logging

3. `/frontend/src/services/products/productLifecycleService.ts`
   - Improved duplicate detection logic with fuzzy matching
   - Added robust error handling and safer database operations
   - Extended lookback window for duplicate detection

## Testing

This fix has been thoroughly tested across multiple scenarios:
- Rapid form submissions
- Various network conditions
- Different user interactions (adding, editing, deleting)
- Edge cases like similar events created close together

## Benefits

- **Data Integrity**: Prevents duplicate database entries
- **Consistent UI**: Eliminates duplicate entries in the user interface
- **Better UX**: Reduces confusion and improves reliability
- **Enhanced Traceability**: Properly attributes events to the current user
- **Improved Performance**: Reduces unnecessary database operations
