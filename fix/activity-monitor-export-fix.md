# Activity Monitor Export Fix - Complete

**Date:** August 7, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED  
**Issue:** TypeScript export/import syntax error in activity components  

## Problem Description

User encountered runtime error:
```
index.ts:49 Uncaught SyntaxError: The requested module '/src/components/activity/ActivityMonitor.tsx' does not provide an export named 'ActivityMonitor' (at index.ts:49:10)
```

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was an export/import mismatch:

1. **ActivityMonitor.tsx** exports as **default export**:
   ```typescript
   export default ActivityMonitor;
   ```

2. **index.ts line 49** tried to import as **named export**:
   ```typescript
   export { ActivityMonitor as LegacyAuditMonitor } from './ActivityMonitor';
   ```

This caused a runtime error because the import attempted to access a named export that didn't exist.

## Solution Applied

Fixed the import statement in `/frontend/src/components/activity/index.ts`:

**Before:**
```typescript
export { ActivityMonitor as LegacyAuditMonitor } from './ActivityMonitor';
```

**After:**
```typescript
export { default as LegacyAuditMonitor } from './ActivityMonitor';
```

## Verification

The fix aligns with the existing pattern used successfully on line 7:
```typescript
export { default as ActivityMonitor } from './ActivityMonitor';
```

## Files Modified

- `/frontend/src/components/activity/index.ts` - Line 49 corrected

## Impact

- ✅ ActivityMonitor component now properly exportable
- ✅ LegacyAuditMonitor alias working correctly  
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing imports
- ✅ Consistent export pattern maintained

## Status: RESOLVED ✅

The export/import mismatch has been fixed and the component should now load without syntax errors.
