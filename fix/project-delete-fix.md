# Project Delete Functionality Fix

## Issue Summary

The project deletion functionality was failing with two main errors:

1. **Transaction Termination Error**:
   ```
   Fallback to manual deletion: {code: '2D000', details: null, hint: null, message: 'invalid transaction termination'}
   ```

2. **Multiple Rows Return Error**:
   ```
   Error deleting project: {code: 'PGRST116', details: 'Results contain 8 rows, application/vnd.pgrst.object+json requires 1 row', hint: null, message: 'JSON object requested, multiple (or no) rows returned'}
   ```

## Root Causes

1. **Incomplete Cascade Deletion**: The `delete_project_cascade` database function didn't handle all tables with foreign key references to the projects table, causing transaction failures.

2. **JSON Object Expectation**: Using `.single()` with queries that could return multiple rows was causing the second error.

## Implemented Fixes

### 1. Front-End Changes (ProjectsList.tsx)

1. **Robust Error Handling**: Added comprehensive try/catch blocks for each deletion step to prevent cascading failures.

2. **Manual Deletion Fallback**: Enhanced the manual deletion process to handle all related tables individually when the RPC function fails.

3. **Query Structure Improvements**: Removed `.single()` where multiple rows could be returned and properly handled empty result sets.

4. **Warning Suppression**: Added proper error filtering to suppress 'no rows' errors that are expected in some cases.

### 2. Back-End Changes (SQL Migration)

1. **Enhanced Database Function**: Created an updated version of the `delete_project_cascade` function that handles all foreign key dependencies comprehensively:
   - Added deletion for all product tables
   - Added deletion for all related entities
   - Maintained proper deletion order to respect foreign key constraints
   - Added explicit transaction handling

## How to Test

1. Create a test project
2. Add subscriptions, documents, or other related entities to the project
3. Try to delete the project
4. Verify the project and all related data are properly removed
5. Check the database to ensure no orphaned records remain

## Additional Improvements

1. **Optimized Database Calls**: Reduced the number of database calls by batching related operations.

2. **Enhanced User Feedback**: Improved toast notifications to provide more specific information about the deletion process.

3. **Comprehensive Error Logging**: Added detailed error logging to help diagnose any future issues.

## Migration Script

A SQL migration script has been added at `/backend/migrations/20250816_update_delete_project_cascade.sql` to update the database function. This script should be run to update the database function for proper cascade deletion.
