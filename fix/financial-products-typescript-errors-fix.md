# Financial Products TypeScript Errors Fix

This fix addresses several TypeScript errors in the financial products implementation.

## Errors Fixed

### 1. DatePicker Component Props in StructuredProductForm

The DatePicker component was being used with incorrect props (`setDate` instead of `onSelect`). This was fixed by updating the component to use the correct prop name that matches the DatePicker interface definition.

**Files modified:**
- `/frontend/src/components/products/product-forms/StructuredProductForm.tsx`

### 2. ProjectWizard Component Props

The ProjectWizard component was passing incompatible props to product form components. This was fixed by refactoring the step 3 implementation to create a more flexible wrapper that properly passes the required props to the dynamically selected form component.

**Files modified:**
- `/frontend/src/components/projects/ProjectWizard.tsx`

### 3. Missing Properties in FundProduct Type

The FundProduct type in ProjectCompatibilityBridge.ts was missing proper handling for several properties:
- `fundVintageYear`: Now properly converts string to number when needed
- `sectorFocus` and `geographicFocus`: Added proper type checking and fallback to empty arrays

**Files modified:**
- `/frontend/src/services/compatibility/ProjectCompatibilityBridge.ts`

### 4. Type Conversion Issues

Fixed a type conversion issue where string values needed to be converted to numbers:
- `carbonOffsetPotential`: Now properly converts string to number using parseFloat

**Files modified:**
- `/frontend/src/services/compatibility/ProjectCompatibilityBridge.ts`

### 5. Incorrect Type Reference

Fixed a reference to non-existent `ProductType` in product-lifecycle-service.ts by replacing it with the correct `ProjectType`.

**Files modified:**
- `/frontend/src/services/product-lifecycle-service.ts`

## Future Improvements

1. Consider creating a utility function for string-to-number conversions to standardize this pattern across the codebase
2. Add proper TypeScript interfaces for all form props to prevent similar issues in the future
3. Consider adding comprehensive tests for the compatibility bridge to ensure proper type handling

## Testing

These changes have been tested by:
1. Verifying that the TypeScript errors are resolved
2. Ensuring that all affected components render properly
3. Validating that data conversions work correctly with different input types

All TypeScript errors related to the financial products implementation have been resolved.
