# Product Form Fixes

## Overview

This implementation fixes form submission issues in all product form components. The fixes have been applied to ensure consistent handling of form validation, error reporting, and form submission across all product types.

## Changes Applied

The following fixes were applied to each product form component:

### 1. Added `onCancel` Support
- Added `onCancel` parameter to component props
- Added conditional rendering of Cancel button

### 2. Enhanced Form Validation
- Added `mode: 'onSubmit'` to useForm options
- Added onError handler to log validation errors

### 3. Improved Form Submission Process
- Added detailed logging throughout the submission process
- Added try/catch blocks for better error handling
- Enhanced debugging with form value and state logging

### 4. Added Debug Submit Button
- Added Debug Submit button for troubleshooting
- Button outputs current form values and state to console
- Manually triggers form submission

## Components Fixed

All 15 product form components have been fixed:

1. StructuredProductForm (already fixed)
2. StablecoinProductForm (already fixed)
3. DigitalTokenizedFundProductForm
4. EnergyProductForm
5. AssetBackedProductForm
6. CollectiblesProductForm
7. InfrastructureProductForm
8. RealEstateProductForm
9. PrivateDebtProductForm
10. QuantitativeInvestmentStrategyProductForm
11. BondProductForm
12. FundProductForm
13. CommoditiesProductForm
14. EquityProductForm
15. PrivateEquityProductForm

## Testing Notes

The fixed components should be tested by:

1. Creating new products of each type
2. Editing existing products
3. Testing validation by submitting with missing required fields
4. Using the Debug Submit button to diagnose any issues
5. Testing the Cancel button functionality

The console logs added throughout the form submission process will help identify any issues with validation or submission.

## Next Steps

1. Monitor form submission performance in production
2. Gather feedback on form usability
3. Consider adding more specific field validation as needed
4. Add unit tests for form validation and submission
