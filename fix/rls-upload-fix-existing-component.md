# RLS Document Upload Error Fix - Updated Existing Component

## Summary
Updated the existing `IssuerDocumentUpload.tsx` component with enhanced authentication checks and RLS error handling, while the **main fix** remains applying the SQL policies.

## Files Modified

### 1. Enhanced IssuerDocumentUpload.tsx ‚úÖ
**File**: `frontend/src/components/compliance/operations/documents/components/IssuerDocumentUpload.tsx`

**Changes Made**:
- ‚úÖ Added authentication context with `useAuth()` hook
- ‚úÖ Enhanced error handling for RLS policy errors with specific messages
- ‚úÖ Added user context display in dialog (shows signed-in email)
- ‚úÖ Added session verification before upload
- ‚úÖ Added file cleanup if database insert fails after upload
- ‚úÖ Enhanced error message with administrator fix guidance

**Key Improvements**:
```typescript
// Shows user authentication status
{user && isAuthenticated && (
  <div className="mt-2 text-sm text-muted-foreground">
    Signed in as: <span className="font-medium">{user.email}</span>
  </div>
)}

// Enhanced RLS error handling
if (uploadError.message?.includes('row-level security policy')) {
  throw new Error(
    'Upload blocked by security policy. This usually means missing storage permissions. ' +
    'Please contact your administrator to configure storage RLS policies for document uploads.'
  );
}

// Administrator guidance in error display
{error.includes('security policy') && (
  <div className="mt-2 text-sm">
    <strong>Administrator Fix Required:</strong><br/>
    Storage RLS policies need to be configured. Execute the SQL script in 
    <code>scripts/immediate-storage-fix.sql</code> in your Supabase dashboard.
  </div>
)}
```

### 2. SQL Fix Script ‚úÖ 
**File**: `scripts/immediate-storage-fix.sql`

**Contains**: 5 essential RLS policies for `storage.objects` table

## üö® **IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED**

Since you're authenticated but still getting RLS errors, you need to run the SQL fix:

### **Step 1: Apply SQL Policies (30 seconds)**
1. Go to **Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí SQL Editor**
2. Copy and paste this SQL:

```sql
-- IMMEDIATE FIX: Create missing storage RLS policies

CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can upload files" ON storage.objects
FOR INSERT 
TO authenticated
WITH CHECK (
  bucket_id IN ('issuer-documents', 'investor-documents', 'project-documents')
);

CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can read files" ON storage.objects
FOR SELECT 
TO authenticated
USING (
  bucket_id IN ('issuer-documents', 'investor-documents', 'project-documents')
);

CREATE POLICY "Public can read files" ON storage.objects
FOR SELECT 
TO public
USING (
  bucket_id IN ('issuer-documents', 'investor-documents', 'project-documents')
);

CREATE POLICY "Users can update their own files" ON storage.objects
FOR UPDATE 
TO authenticated
USING (owner = auth.uid())
WITH CHECK (owner = auth.uid());

CREATE POLICY "Users can delete their own files" ON storage.objects
FOR DELETE 
TO authenticated
USING (owner = auth.uid());
```

3. **Click "Run"**
4. **Test upload immediately**

### **Step 2: Verify Fix**
After running the SQL, your upload should work immediately. The enhanced component will now show:
- ‚úÖ "Signed in as: your-email@domain.com" 
- ‚úÖ Successful uploads without RLS errors
- ‚úÖ Better error messages if other issues occur

### **Step 3: Test Upload**
1. Go to `http://localhost:5173/compliance/upload/issuer`
2. Try uploading a document
3. Should work without the RLS error

## Expected Results

### Before Fix:
```
‚ùå Error: "new row violates row-level security policy"
‚ùå Cryptic error message
‚ùå No user context shown
```

### After Fix:
```
‚úÖ Shows: "Signed in as: your-email@domain.com"
‚úÖ Upload succeeds without RLS errors  
‚úÖ Clear error messages if other issues occur
‚úÖ Administrator guidance for any remaining policy issues
```

## Why This Happened
- ‚úÖ **User Authentication**: Working correctly (you're signed in as super admin)
- ‚úÖ **Storage Buckets**: Exist and configured properly
- ‚ùå **RLS Policies**: Missing on `storage.objects` table
- ‚ùå **Result**: All storage operations blocked regardless of authentication

The SQL fix creates the missing policies that allow authenticated users to upload to document storage buckets.

## Files Updated Summary
1. ‚úÖ `IssuerDocumentUpload.tsx` - Enhanced with auth context and better error handling
2. ‚úÖ `scripts/immediate-storage-fix.sql` - SQL policies fix
3. ‚úÖ `docs/rls-upload-fix-existing-component.md` - This documentation

**The main fix is the SQL policies - the component enhancements provide better UX and error guidance.**
