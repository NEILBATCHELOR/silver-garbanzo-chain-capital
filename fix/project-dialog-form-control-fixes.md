# Project Dialog Form Control Fixes

## Issues Fixed

1. **Organization Selection Issue**:
   - Fixed issue with organization_id not updating properly
   - Changed from using `defaultValue` to `value` in the Select component
   - Ensured proper handling of null/undefined values with fallback to empty string

2. **Switch Component Warning**:
   - Fixed React warning about Switch changing from uncontrolled to controlled 
   - Changed `checked={field.value}` to `checked={field.value === true}`
   - Ensured proper boolean casting when reading from defaultValues

3. **Boolean Value Handling**:
   - Fixed initialization of boolean value for is_primary
   - Changed `defaultValues.is_primary || false` to `defaultValues.is_primary === true`
   - This ensures proper treatment of null/undefined values as false

## Technical Details

The key issues were related to React's handling of controlled components:

1. **Organization Select**: Using `defaultValue` instead of `value` can cause components to behave as uncontrolled on first render and controlled on subsequent renders. By using `value` with proper null/undefined handling, we ensure the component remains consistently controlled.

2. **Boolean Handling**: JavaScript treats `null`, `undefined`, `0`, `''`, and `NaN` as falsy, which can cause issues with boolean form fields. By explicitly comparing with `=== true`, we ensure consistent handling of boolean values.

3. **Form Reset**: We also ensured that the form reset properly initializes all fields, including organization_id, to maintain form state consistency.

## Implementation Notes

- For dropdown components like Select, using `value={field.value || ""}` ensures the component always has a defined value, even if the database returns null
- For boolean components like Switch, using `checked={field.value === true}` ensures consistent behavior even with undefined values
- We maintained all fields from the projects database schema to ensure complete data handling
