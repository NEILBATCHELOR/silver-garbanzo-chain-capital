# Wallet Connection Error Fix (Code 4001)

## Issue Description
Error code 4001 "User rejected the request" appearing in browser console, indicating automatic wallet connection attempts without user initiation.

## Root Cause
Multiple wallet connection systems causing conflicts:
- WalletContext making direct ethereum provider calls
- Wagmi/Reown AppKit system
- DFNS managed wallets

## Solution: Enhanced Wallet Manager

### 1. Enhanced Wallet Connection Manager
Create a centralized wallet management system that prevents automatic connections and provides better error handling.

### 2. User-Initiated Connections Only
Ensure wallet connections are only triggered by explicit user actions.

### 3. Error Handling Improvements
Better handling of user rejections and connection failures.

### 4. Unified Wallet Interface
Single interface for all wallet connection types (MetaMask, WalletConnect, DFNS).

## Files to Update
