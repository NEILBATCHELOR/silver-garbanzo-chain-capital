# NAV TypeScript Errors Fix

## Overview
Fixed critical TypeScript compilation errors in the NAV implementation that were blocking development.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Type Mismatch: NavCalculationResult vs CalculationResult

**Problem:** 
- Service layer (`NavService.ts`) defined `NavCalculationResult` with `approvalStatus?: 'draft' | 'validated' | 'approved' | 'rejected' | 'published'`
- Types layer (`nav.ts`) defined `CalculationResult` with `approvalStatus?: ApprovalStatus` (enum)
- Hooks were using `CalculationResult` but service returned `NavCalculationResult`

**Solution:**
- Updated `NavCalculationResult` in service to use `ApprovalStatus` enum type

- `/frontend/src/services/nav/NavService.ts` - Line 55 (approvalStatus type)
- `/frontend/src/hooks/nav/useAsyncCalculation.ts` - Multiple lines (type references)
