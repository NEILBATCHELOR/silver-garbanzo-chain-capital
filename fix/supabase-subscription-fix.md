# Supabase Subscription Fix

## Issue
The application was encountering an error when trying to use Supabase's real-time subscriptions:

```
TypeError: channel.subscribe(...).then is not a function at setupSubscription (useSupabaseSubscription.ts:91:12)
```

This error occurred in the `ProductLifecycleManager` component when it tried to set up a Supabase subscription for real-time updates.

## Root Cause
The error was caused by changes in the Supabase JavaScript client API. In newer versions of the Supabase client, the `channel.subscribe()` method no longer returns a Promise, but our code was trying to use `.then()` and `.catch()` on it.

## Fix
The fix involved updating the `useSupabaseSubscription.ts` hook to properly handle the new Supabase API behavior:

1. Removed the `.then()` and `.catch()` chain on the `channel.subscribe()` method
2. Assigned the channel to the subscription variable directly
3. Added error handling inside the subscription callback
4. Removed the `async` keyword from the `setupSubscription` function since it no longer uses `await`

## Affected Files
- `/frontend/src/hooks/supabase/useSupabaseSubscription.ts`

## Testing
The fix should allow the `ProductLifecycleManager` component to properly establish Supabase real-time subscriptions without throwing errors. The component now correctly handles subscription status and falls back to polling when real-time updates are not available.
