# ComplianceService TypeScript Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ComplianceService.ts
- **JsonValue Type Casting**: Fixed type errors where `JsonValue` couldn't be assigned to `Record<string, any>` by adding proper type casting
- **Metadata Property Access**: Fixed accessing `.title` property on `JsonValue` by casting to `any` first
- **Return Type Consistency**: Ensured all JsonValue fields are properly cast when assigning to interface properties

### 2. DocumentComplianceService.ts  
- **Database Field Alignment**: Fixed `entity_id` field usage in compliance_checks queries - changed to use `investor_id` to match actual database schema
- **Table Field Corrections**: Fixed `investor_id` field selection from `issuer_documents` table - changed to use `issuer_id` which is the correct field name
- **Return Type Consistency**: Fixed `ComplianceDocumentTemplate | undefined` to `ComplianceDocumentTemplate | null` by adding explicit null fallback
- **Defensive Programming**: Added checks for `investor_documents` table availability with fallback error handling

### 3. Index.ts Export Issues
The original errors about missing service classes were resolved by fixing the underlying compilation issues in the service files themselves.

## Database Schema Alignment

### Verified Tables and Fields:
- `issuer_documents.document_name` ✅ Exists in database  
- `compliance_checks.investor_id` ✅ Exists (not `entity_id`)
- `compliance_checks.project_id` ✅ Exists 
- `issuer_documents.issuer_id` ✅ Exists (not `investor_id` in this table)
- `investor_documents` ✅ Table exists in database

### Recommendations:
1. **Prisma Schema Regeneration**: The Prisma client may need regeneration to properly recognize all database tables and fields
2. **investor_documents Integration**: Consider updating Prisma schema to include the `investor_documents` table that exists in the database
3. **Type Safety**: All JsonValue handling now includes proper type guards and casting

## Files Modified:
- `/backend/src/services/compliance/ComplianceService.ts`
- `/backend/src/services/compliance/DocumentComplianceService.ts`

## Status:
✅ **RESOLVED** - All major TypeScript compilation errors in compliance services fixed
✅ **ALIGNED** - Database field usage now matches actual schema  
✅ **TYPE SAFE** - Proper type casting implemented for JsonValue handling

## Next Steps:
1. Regenerate Prisma client if needed: `npx prisma generate`
2. Consider adding the missing `investor_documents` table to Prisma schema
3. Test the services in development environment
