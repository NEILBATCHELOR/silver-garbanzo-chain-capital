# SubscriptionPlans Deletion Fix

## Issue
- User deleted `SubscriptionPlans.tsx` file on purpose
- HMR (Hot Module Replacement) was failing with error: `Failed to reload /src/components/subscriptions/SubscriptionPlans.tsx`
- `SubscriptionManager.tsx` was still importing and using the deleted component

## Changes Made

### Files Modified
- `/src/components/subscriptions/SubscriptionManager.tsx`

### Specific Changes
1. **Removed broken import**: Commented out the import statement for SubscriptionPlans
2. **Added temporary placeholder**: Replaced SubscriptionPlans component with a simple placeholder UI
3. **Preserved functionality**: SubscriptionManager still works, just shows "Plans Coming Soon" message

## Current State
- ✅ HMR errors resolved
- ✅ Application builds without errors
- ✅ SubscriptionManager component renders properly
- ✅ Temporary placeholder prevents crashes

## Next Steps (Optional)
If you want to restore subscription plans functionality:
1. Create a new SubscriptionPlans component
2. Replace the placeholder with the actual component
3. Implement plan selection logic

## Code Changes
```typescript
// Before: import SubscriptionPlans from "./SubscriptionPlans";
// After: // import SubscriptionPlans from "./SubscriptionPlans"; // Removed - file deleted

// Before: <SubscriptionPlans currentPlanId={...} onSelectPlan={...} />
// After: Temporary placeholder UI with "Plans Coming Soon" message
```

## Status
✅ **COMPLETED** - Build-blocking error resolved
