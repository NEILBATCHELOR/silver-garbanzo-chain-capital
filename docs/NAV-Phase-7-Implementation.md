  marketStressScore: number          // Overall market stress indicator (0-100)
}
```

**Compliance Metrics**:
```typescript
interface StablecoinComplianceMetrics {
  reserveAdequacy: boolean           // Sufficient backing (‚â•100%)
  attestationCurrent: boolean        // Recent third-party verification
  regulatoryCompliance: boolean      // Framework compliance
  pegStability: boolean              // Within deviation tolerance
  redemptionOperational: boolean     // Redemption mechanism functioning
  auditTrail: boolean                // Unqualified audit opinion
  transparencyScore: number          // Public disclosure quality (0-100)
  trustScore: number                 // Composite trust rating (0-100)
}
```

## Architecture Integration

### Calculator Registry

Both calculators are automatically registered with the `CalculatorRegistry` and support:

- **Dynamic Resolution**: Automatic selection based on asset type
- **Health Checking**: Continuous monitoring and automatic failover
- **Performance Metrics**: Resolution time and success rate tracking
- **Caching**: Efficient calculation result caching

### Base Calculator Features

Both calculators extend `BaseCalculator` and inherit:

- **Decimal Precision**: 28-decimal places for financial accuracy
- **FX Conversion**: Multi-currency support with rate tracking
- **Validation Framework**: Input and output validation with severity levels
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error catching and reporting
- **Observability**: Metrics collection and performance monitoring

## Database Integration

### Required Tables

**Money Market Funds**:
- `fund_products` - MMF product configurations
- `asset_holdings` - Individual security holdings
- Additional fields for MMF-specific data (maturity dates, ratings, etc.)

**Fiat-backed Stablecoins**:
- `stablecoin_products` - Stablecoin configurations and parameters
- `asset_holdings` - Reserve asset details
- Attestation records and compliance tracking tables

## Testing Strategy

### Test Coverage Areas

**MmfCalculator Tests**:
- SEC Rule 2a-7 compliance validation
- WAM/WAL calculation accuracy
- Liquidity requirement enforcement
- Shadow pricing deviation detection
- Stress test scenario execution
- Credit quality scoring
- Amortized cost calculations

**StablecoinFiatCalculator Tests**:
- Reserve adequacy validation
- Peg deviation monitoring
- Attestation verification logic
- Depeg risk assessment
- Compliance metrics calculation
- Reserve composition analysis
- Multi-currency support

## Performance Considerations

### Calculation Complexity
- **MmfCalculator**: O(n) where n = number of holdings
- **StablecoinFiatCalculator**: O(m) where m = number of reserve assets
- Both support caching for expensive operations (stress tests, risk calculations)

### Memory Usage
- Decimal.js precision: ~50 bytes per calculation
- Risk metrics caching: ~2KB per calculation result
- Historical data requirements: Minimal (30-day rolling window)

## Error Handling

### Common Error Scenarios

**MmfCalculator**:
- SEC compliance violations (WAM/WAL exceeded)
- Insufficient liquidity ratios
- Credit quality deterioration
- Missing security maturity data

**StablecoinFiatCalculator**:
- Insufficient reserve backing
- Peg deviation beyond thresholds
- Stale attestation records
- Redemption mechanism failures

### Graceful Degradation
- Fallback to conservative estimates when data is incomplete
- Warning-level validation for minor compliance issues
- Automatic retry with exponential backoff for transient failures

## Next Steps (Phase 8)

### Remaining Priority Calculators

1. **StablecoinCryptoCalculator** implementation:
   - Collateralization ratio monitoring
   - Liquidation risk assessment
   - Protocol-specific mechanics (MakerDAO, Synthetix, etc.)

2. **CommoditiesCalculator** implementation:
   - Spot price integration
   - Storage and carrying costs
   - Quality adjustments and delivery specifications

3. **AssetBackedCalculator** implementation:
   - Underlying asset valuation
   - Tranching and waterfall calculations
   - Credit enhancement factors

### System Enhancements
- Market data integration (Phase 10)
- FX rate service integration (Phase 10)
- Real-time pricing feeds
- Advanced stress testing scenarios
- Enhanced validation rules

## Summary

Phase 7 successfully delivers sophisticated NAV calculation capabilities for Money Market Funds and Fiat-backed Stablecoins, bringing the system to **4 out of 7** completed priority calculators. The implementations provide:

- **Regulatory Compliance**: Full SEC Rule 2a-7 support for MMFs
- **Risk Management**: Comprehensive risk assessment frameworks
- **Financial Precision**: 28-decimal place accuracy for all calculations
- **Production Ready**: Full error handling, validation, and observability
- **Extensible Architecture**: Clean patterns for remaining calculator implementations

The foundation is now solid for completing the remaining 3 priority calculators in Phase 8, after which the system will support comprehensive NAV calculations for the core asset types in institutional finance.
