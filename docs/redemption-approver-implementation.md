# Redemption Approver Implementation

## Overview
This implementation adds the ability to set approvers for redemption requests, following the same pattern as the PolicyCreationModal's Approvers tab.

## Implementation Details

### New Components
1. **RedemptionApproverSelection** (`/src/components/redemption/components/RedemptionApproverSelection.tsx`)
   - Based on the existing `ApproverSelection` component from the rules module
   - Provides search, selection, and management of approvers for redemption requests
   - Includes approval threshold configuration (all, majority, any)
   - Supports min/max approver limits (default: 1-5)

### Modified Components
1. **RedemptionRequestForm** (`/src/components/redemption/requests/RedemptionRequestForm.tsx`)
   - Added approver selection section after the "Additional Notes" field
   - Integrated approver validation into form submission
   - Added state management for selected approvers
   - Updated submission validation to require at least one approver

## Pattern Consistency
This implementation follows the exact same pattern as the PolicyCreationModal:
- Uses the same `useApprovers` hook for loading eligible approvers
- Same UI components (Avatar, Badge, Tooltip, Card, etc.)
- Same search and selection functionality
- Same approval threshold options
- Same error handling and loading states

## Features
- **Search Functionality**: Search approvers by name, email, or role
- **Approval Thresholds**: Configure whether all, majority, or any approver is required
- **Real-time Validation**: Form submission is blocked until at least one approver is selected
- **Error Handling**: Clear error messages for missing approvers or loading failures
- **Loading States**: Skeleton loading and retry functionality
- **Avatar Support**: Auto-generated avatars based on user initials

## Integration Points
- Integrates with existing `useApprovers` hook from `/src/hooks/rule/useApprovers`
- Uses existing redemption types and interfaces
- Compatible with existing redemption services and workflows
- Follows the same component organization as other redemption modules

## Usage
```tsx
import { RedemptionApproverSelection } from '@/components/redemption/components';

<RedemptionApproverSelection
  selectedApprovers={selectedApprovers}
  onApproversChange={handleApproversChange}
  minApprovers={1}
  maxApprovers={5}
/>
```

## Future Enhancements
- Database integration for persisting approvers with redemption requests
- Real-time approval workflow integration
- Enhanced approval delegation features
- Integration with the existing approval service for actual approval processing

## Testing Notes
- Approver selection functionality is fully functional in the UI
- Form validation includes approver requirements
- Component follows established patterns and should integrate seamlessly
- Database persistence would require updates to the redemption service layer

## Files Modified
1. `/src/components/redemption/components/RedemptionApproverSelection.tsx` (new)
2. `/src/components/redemption/components/index.ts` (new)
3. `/src/components/redemption/requests/RedemptionRequestForm.tsx` (modified)
4. `/src/components/redemption/index.ts` (modified)

This implementation provides a complete approver selection interface that matches the existing PolicyCreationModal pattern while being specifically tailored for redemption requests.
