Important emphasis for the UI Design Treatment 6:

**1. Integration of Token Servicing & Asset Lifecycle Sequence
Diagrams**

Each **core function** (Minting, Burning, Redemptions, Pausing, Locking,
Blocking, Force Transfers, Conditional Transfers) will be mapped
**directly into the UI wireframe outline** to:

Show how **users interact** with the UI for each function.

Define **responsible roles** for approvals and executions.

Ensure compliance through **multi-sig approvals** and **Guardian Policy
Enforcement.**

**2. Addition of Multi-Signature Governance in Key Workflows**

**Bulk operations (whitelisting, redemptions, cap table updates) will
require multi-signature approvals** from designated approvers.

**UI components will reflect pending approvals, governance requests, and
tracking notifications.**

Actions like **forced transfers, compliance overrides, and issuer-driven
redemptions** will include **multi-signature verification stages**
before final execution.

**3. Expanded Compliance & Audit Logging**

- **A dedicated compliance & audit log panel** will track:

  - Approval stages for **redemptions, transfers, blocking/unblocking,
    and servicing changes**.

  - **Guardian Policy Enforcement validation results** before execution.

  - Blockchain-based **immutable tracking of lifecycle events.**

**4. Enhanced UI for Lifecycle Operations**

The wireframe structure will now include:

- **Real-time cap table updates based on servicing operations** (i.e.,
  redemptions auto-adjusting holdings).

- **Investor transaction alerts & governance voting panels** for
  corporate actions.

- **Compliance dashboards for tracking regulatory violations and
  flagging risky investor behaviour.**

**5. New Workflow Sections for Each Token-Based Function**

The next update will ensure a dedicated breakdown for:

**Redemptions (Token Buyback & Payouts)** -- Investor request
validation, multi-sig approval, token burning.

**Minting & Burning** -- Token supply adjustments, credit enhancement
enforcement.

**Pausing & Locking** -- Compliance-driven event freezes, automatic rule
enforcement.

**Blocking & Unblocking** -- Regulatory restrictions on investor
transactions.

**Force Transfers** -- Dispute resolution, liquidation events,
issuer-driven token movement.

**Conditional Transfers** -- KYC enforcement, eligibility checks,
jurisdiction restrictions.

**Cap Table Synchronisation** -- Blockchain updates for investor
holdings post-servicing.

**Investor Management** -- Bulk investor approvals, KYC updates,
eligibility tracking.

**Lifecycle Rule-Based Automation** -- Setting asset-specific rules for
automated compliance enforcement.
