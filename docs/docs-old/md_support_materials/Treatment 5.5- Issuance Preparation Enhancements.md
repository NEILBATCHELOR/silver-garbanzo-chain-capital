**Enhancements Needed for the Issuance Flow:**

Expanded Role Definitions & Permissions

Issuer (Owner Role)

Explicitly define oversight responsibilities for whitelisting &
allocation of investor wallets.

Enforce that issuers must monitor onboarding compliance progress before
issuing tokens.

Agent (Investment Manager, Placement Agent, Fund Administrator)

Incorporate assistance roles in investor onboarding & compliance
approvals.

Highlight their function in token distribution & investor cap table
updates.

Legal & Compliance Agents

Enforce that legal structuring and regulatory approvals must be
finalised before token issuance.

Require explicit compliance verification before Guardian Policy
Enforcement allows final issuance.

Guardian Wallet

Ensure that issuance wallets are only created after compliance approvals
are complete.

Add logic to secure issuance funds & manage investor subscriptions.

Guardian Policy Enforcement

Implement strict transfer restrictions & whitelist enforcement rules.

Ensure issuers cannot launch tokenised securities without compliance
validation.

Stronger Multi-Signature Governance in Issuance

Require multi-sig approvals for:

Token deployment finalisation.

Issuance wallet funding authorisation.

Transfer restrictions enforcement.

Ensure no single party (Issuer, Compliance, or Chain Capital) can
proceed unilaterally.

Enhanced Cap Table & Compliance Synchronisation

Automatically update investor allocation records post-issuance.

Ensure real-time synchronisation of investor eligibility & compliance.

Regulatory transparency: Enable compliance agents to generate regulatory
reports post-issuance.

Improved Investor Subscription Tracking & Post-Issuance Monitoring

Track investor onboarding completeness before allocation.

Implement real-time investor fund movement tracking.

Agents and legal teams should have visibility into secondary market
transactions.
