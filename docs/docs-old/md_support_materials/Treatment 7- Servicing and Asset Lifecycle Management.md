compliance monitoring** while integrating **Guardian[']{dir="rtl"}s
policy enforcement, investor controls, and role-based access.**

**Primary Users**

Legal Counsel)**

**Placement Agents, Administrators, Broker-Dealers**

**Investors (Managing Holdings, Transfers, and Redemptions)**

**Multi-Sig Approvers (Responsible for approving high-value
transactions)**
