**Functional and UI Specification for Rule Management Tab in Chain
Capital[']{dir="rtl"}s Issuance Module**

**1. Overview**

The **Rule Management Tab** in Chain Capital[']{dir="rtl"}s **Issuance
Module** will allow token issuers and administrators to configure,
enforce, and manage conditional transfer rules for digital securities.
This will ensure compliance, regulatory adherence, and transaction
security.

The interface should provide:

**A Dashboard** summarising all active and inactive rules.

**Rule Categories** based on conditional transfer types.

**Configuration Panels** for setting parameters.

**Approval & Audit Logs** for tracking rule modifications.

**Integration with Guardian Policy Enforcement and Wallet Execution.**
