### API Architecture Enhancement

**Recommended API Design Principles:**
- Versioning: Prefix all routes with `/api/v1/`
- RESTful standards with proper HTTP methods
- Idempotency for safe retry behavior
- Rate limiting per endpoint/IP scope
- Input validation using Zod or Joi
- JWT authorization with Supabase RLS policies
- Comprehensive audit logging for sensitive operations

**Swagger/OpenAPI Integration:**
- Full API documentation generated via swagger-jsdoc
- Routes annotated with JSDoc comments
- Served on `/api/docs` endpoint
- JSON spec export for Postman/external tools

### Infrastructure & Deployment Strategy

**Docker Optimization:**
