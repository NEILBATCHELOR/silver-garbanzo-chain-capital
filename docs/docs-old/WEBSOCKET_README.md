# WebSocket Connection Error Resolution

## Overview of the Issue

The application was experiencing WebSocket connection errors during development:

```
WalletAddressReceiver.ts:39 WebSocket connection to 'wss://wallet-service.example.com/ws' failed: 
```

These errors occurred because:
1. The WebSocket service URL was set to a non-existent example domain
2. The environment variable wasn't properly configured
3. There was no graceful handling of connection failures in development

## Solution Implemented

We've implemented a comprehensive solution to handle these errors properly:

### 1. Environment Configuration

- Created proper TypeScript type definitions for Vite environment variables in `src/env.d.ts`
- Added environment variables for WebSocket configuration in `.env.local`:
  ```
  VITE_WALLET_WS_URL=wss://localhost:8080/ws
  ```
- Updated `WalletContext.tsx` to use Vite's `import.meta.env` syntax instead of `process.env`

### 2. Error Handling in WalletAddressReceiver

- Added detection for development/test URLs to suppress unnecessary console errors
- Made the reconnection logic more intelligent with a progressive backoff strategy
- Added proper cleanup to avoid memory leaks

### 3. Mock WebSocket Server for Development

- Created a mock WebSocket server implementation in `src/mocks/websocketServer.js`
- The mock intercepts WebSocket connections to development URLs and simulates successful connections
- Integrated it into the application's startup process in `main.tsx`
- Provides simulated wallet address data during development

## Using the WebSocket Service

### Production Environment

For production, set the actual WebSocket service URL in your environment:

```
VITE_WALLET_WS_URL=wss://your-real-wallet-service.com/ws
```

### Development Environment

During development, you have three options:

1. **Use the mock implementation (recommended):**
   - The built-in mock will simulate WebSocket connections
   - No configuration needed, works automatically

2. **Run a local WebSocket server:**
   - Set `VITE_WALLET_WS_URL=ws://localhost:8080/ws`
   - Run your local WebSocket server on port 8080

3. **Connect to a development WebSocket service:**
   - Set `VITE_WALLET_WS_URL` to your development service URL
   - Errors will be properly suppressed if the service is unavailable

## Troubleshooting

If you still see WebSocket errors in the console:

1. Check that the mock is properly initialized in `main.tsx`
2. Verify that your environment variables are correctly set in `.env.local`
3. Ensure you're not using WebSocket connections outside of the `WalletAddressReceiver` class
