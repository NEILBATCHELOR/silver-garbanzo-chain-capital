# TokenStandardSelector Enhancement

## Overview
Enhanced the TokenStandardSelector component to be more compact and aesthetically pleasing, following the card design patterns used in the TokenizationManager dashboard.

## Changes Made

### 1. **Compact Card Design**
- Reduced card padding from `p-6` to `p-4`
- Changed from single column layout to responsive grid: `grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3`
- Reduced gaps between cards from `gap-6` to `gap-3`

### 2. **Visual Improvements**
- Added color-coded badges and selection indicators
- Implemented consistent color theming for each token standard:
  - ERC-20: Blue theme
  - ERC-721: Purple theme
  - ERC-1155: Amber theme
  - ERC-1400: Green theme
  - ERC-3525: Pink theme
  - ERC-4626: Cyan theme

### 3. **Enhanced User Experience**
- Added check icon for selected standards
- Improved hover states with shadow effects
- Better visual hierarchy with proper spacing
- Compact technical details in a grid layout
- Enhanced tooltips with structured information

### 4. **Design Consistency**
- Follows the same card pattern as FactoringDashboard
- Consistent with TokenizationManager pool selection cards
- Uses proper shadcn/ui component patterns
- Responsive design that works on mobile, tablet, and desktop
