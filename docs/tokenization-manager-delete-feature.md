# Tokenization Manager Delete Feature

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation of token deletion protection and improved pool selection in the Tokenization Manager module.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Token Deletion Protection

- Added functionality to prevent tokens that have been allocated to investors from being deleted
- When a token has allocations in the `token_allocations` table, the delete option is disabled
- The system shows a clear error message if a user attempts to delete an allocated token

### 2. Improved Pool Selection Logic

- Enhanced the pool selection dropdown to disable pools that:
  - Have been fully allocated (distributed status)
  - Have tokens that have already been allocated to investors
- Added clear visual indicators in the dropdown showing allocation status:
  - "(Fully allocated)" for pools with distributed tokens
  - "(Has allocated tokens)" for pools with tokens that have allocations

## Technical Implementation

1. **Token Allocation Check**
   - Added state tracking for tokens with allocations
   - Implemented database checks to prevent deletion of allocated tokens
   - Added UI indicators to disable the delete option for allocated tokens

2. **Pool Selection Enhancement**
   - Implemented logic to track which pools have tokens with allocations
   - Added filtering to identify pools with available tokens
   - Updated both create and edit token dialogs to respect allocation status

## Usage

- Users can now only delete tokens that have not been allocated to investors
- When creating new tokens, users will only see pools that have remaining unallocated tokens available
- In the edit token dialog, all pools are available for the current token, but other allocated pools are disabled

This implementation ensures that tokens with allocations cannot be accidentally deleted, preventing data inconsistency issues.
