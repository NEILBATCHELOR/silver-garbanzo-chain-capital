# Product-Specific Project Enhancement

This enhancement adds product-specific forms, details, and lifecycle management to projects based on the 15 financial product categories defined in the database schema.

## Implemented Components

### Core Components

1. **Product Type Selector**: 
   - Location: `/src/components/products/selector/product-type-selector.tsx`
   - Purpose: Allows users to select from 15 different financial product types when creating a new project

2. **Product Factory**:
   - Location: `/src/components/products/factory/product-factory.tsx`
   - Purpose: Dynamically loads the appropriate forms and detail components based on product type

3. **Project Wizard**:
   - Location: `/src/components/projects/ProjectWizard.tsx`
   - Purpose: Multi-step wizard for creating new projects with product-specific forms

### Product-Specific Components

4. **Structured Product Form**:
   - Location: `/src/components/products/forms/structured-product-form.tsx`
   - Purpose: Example implementation of a product-specific form

5. **Structured Product Details**:
   - Location: `/src/components/products/details/structured-product-details.tsx`
   - Purpose: Example implementation of product-specific details view

6. **Product Lifecycle Events**:
   - Location: `/src/components/products/lifecycle/product-lifecycle-events.tsx`
   - Purpose: Component for managing and displaying lifecycle events for products

## Database Integration

These components integrate with the existing database schema that includes:

- Product-specific tables (structured_products, equity_products, etc.)
- Product lifecycle events table
- Relationships to the projects table

## Next Steps

1. **Additional Product Forms**: Implement forms for the remaining product types
2. **Additional Product Detail Views**: Implement detail views for the remaining product types
3. **Route Integration**: Add routes for the project wizard and project details
4. **Testing**: Test all components with actual data
5. **Documentation**: Add documentation for developers on how to add new product types

## Benefits

- Each product type now has tailored UI components for its specific fields
- Users can see only relevant fields for their product type
- Lifecycle management is tied to specific product types
- The system is extensible for new product types

## References

- Product types and fields are based on the comprehensive database schema documentation
- Uses shadcn/ui components for the UI
- Integrates with existing ProductLifecycleService for event management
