# Financial Products UI Update

## Changes Made

This update removes two visual UI elements from the Product Lifecycle Management feature:

1. **Removed Real-time Updates Badge**
   - Eliminated the green badge with "Real-time updates" text in the Product Lifecycle Manager header
   - The badge previously appeared when real-time updates were active
   - Functionality remains intact; only the visual indicator has been removed

2. **Removed Timeline Green Dots**
   - Eliminated the colored dots in the timeline view
   - Previously, these dots showed different colors based on event status
   - The timeline structure remains intact, just without the colored status indicators

## Files Modified

1. `/frontend/src/components/products/lifecycle/product-lifecycle-manager.tsx`
   - Removed the real-time updates badge that appeared in the component header

2. `/frontend/src/components/products/lifecycle/lifecycle-timeline.tsx`
   - Removed the colored dots from the timeline events
   - Maintained the timeline layout and spacing

## Impact

These changes create a cleaner, more minimal UI for the Product Lifecycle Management feature without affecting functionality. Users can still see event status through the badges on each event item.

## Remaining Items

All requested UI changes have been completed. The system continues to work with real-time updates, but the visual indicators have been removed as requested.
