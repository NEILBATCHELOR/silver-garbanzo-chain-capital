# Redemption UI Cleanup - Complete

**Date:** August 23, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED  
**Impact:** UI simplification and cleanup

## Task Overview

Removed specific UI elements from redemption pages to simplify the interface as requested:

### Target Pages
- **Redemption Windows:** `http://localhost:5173/redemption/windows`
- **Redemption Configuration:** `http://localhost:5173/redemption/configure`

## Changes Made

### 1. RedemptionWindowManager.tsx
**Location:** `/frontend/src/components/redemption/dashboard/RedemptionWindowManager.tsx`

#### Removed Elements:
- ✅ **Header section** containing:
  - `<h2>` with "Redemption Windows" title
  - `<p>` with "Create and manage redemption periods for your fund" subtitle
- ✅ **Filter card** containing:
  - "Filter by Organization, Project & Product" title
  - Organization dropdown filter
  - Project dropdown filter  
  - Product Type dropdown filter
  - Product dropdown filter

#### Code Cleanup:
- ✅ Removed `Filter` import from lucide-react
- ✅ Removed filter state variables (`filters`, `organizations`, `projects`, `products`)
- ✅ Removed `loadFilterData()` function
- ✅ Updated `useEffect()` to not call `loadFilterData()`
- ✅ Updated `loadWindows()` to not use filter parameters
- ✅ Replaced header with simple "Create Window" button alignment

### 2. RedemptionConfigurationDashboard.tsx
**Location:** `/frontend/src/components/redemption/dashboard/RedemptionConfigurationDashboard.tsx`

#### Removed Elements:
- ✅ **Header section** containing:
  - `<h1>` with "Redemption Configuration" title
  - `<p>` with "Configure redemption rules and windows for your project" subtitle
  - Second **Refresh button** with TrendingUp icon

#### Code Cleanup:
