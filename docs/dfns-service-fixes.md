# DFNS Service Fixes - TypeScript Error Resolution

## Issues Resolved

### 1. Missing Methods in DfnsService
**Error**: Property 'estimateTransferFee' does not exist on type 'DfnsService'
**Fix**: ✅ Added `estimateTransferFee()` method to both `dfnsService.ts` and `real-dfns-service-corrected.ts`

**Error**: Property 'createTransfer' does not exist on type 'DfnsService'  
**Fix**: ✅ Added `createTransfer()` method to both service classes

**Error**: Property 'delegateWallet' does not exist on type 'DfnsService'
**Fix**: ✅ Added `delegateWallet()` method to both service classes

### 2. Network Type Mismatch
**Error**: Type 'DfnsNetwork' is not assignable to expected literal union
**Fix**: ✅ Updated `createWallet()` method signatures to accept `string` in addition to specific network literals

### 3. Export Issues
**Error**: Module has no exported member 'dfnsService'
**Fix**: ✅ Added `dfnsService` export to `real-dfns-service-corrected.ts` for compatibility

## Files Modified

1. `/frontend/src/services/dfns/dfnsService.ts`
   - Added `estimateTransferFee()` method with gas estimation logic
   - Added `createTransfer()` method with ERC-20 and native token support
   - Added `delegateWallet()` method for wallet delegation
   - Updated `createWallet()` to accept broader network types and externalId

2. `/frontend/src/services/dfns/real-dfns-service-corrected.ts`
   - Added same missing methods as above
   - Updated network type acceptance
   - Added compatible export for `dfnsService`

## Method Implementations

### estimateTransferFee()
- Provides gas estimation for transfers
- Returns gasLimit, gasPrice, maxFeePerGas, maxPriorityFeePerGas
- Currently uses typical mainnet values (placeholder for real estimation)

### createTransfer()
- Supports both native token and ERC-20 token transfers
- Handles gas parameters and memo fields
- Returns transfer ID, status, and transaction hash

### delegateWallet()
- Enables wallet delegation to another user
- Simple wrapper around DFNS delegateWallet API

## Testing Required

- [ ] Test wallet creation with DfnsNetwork enum values
- [ ] Test transfer fee estimation
- [ ] Test transfer creation for native tokens
- [ ] Test transfer creation for ERC-20 tokens  
- [ ] Test wallet delegation functionality
- [ ] Verify all imports resolve correctly

## Next Steps

1. **Environment Setup**: Follow `DFNS_ENVIRONMENT_SETUP.md` to configure DFNS credentials
2. **Implementation Steps**: Follow `DFNS_IMPLEMENTATION_STEPS.md` for real API integration
3. **Testing**: Create test component to verify all methods work with real DFNS API
4. **Replace Mocks**: Ensure components use real DFNS service instead of mock data

## Validation Checklist

- [x] TypeScript compilation errors resolved
- [x] All required methods implemented in both service classes
- [x] Network type compatibility ensured
- [x] Export consistency maintained
- [ ] Real API integration tested
- [ ] Components working with live data
