# Product-Specific Event Cards Implementation

This implementation adds specialized event cards for various financial product types to enhance the lifecycle management system. Each product type now has dedicated visualizations for its specific event types, providing a more intuitive and informative user experience.

## Implementation Overview

The following product-specific event cards have been implemented:

1. **Structured Product Event Card** (existing implementation)
   - Special visualization for barrier hit events
   - Enhanced display for coupon payment events

2. **Bond Product Event Card** (new)
   - Specialized cards for coupon payments
   - Custom visualizations for maturity events
   - Enhanced display for call events

3. **Equity Product Event Card** (new)
   - Specialized cards for dividend payments
   - Custom visualizations for stock splits (rebalance events)
   - Enhanced display for valuation updates
   - Special display for acquisition/merger events

4. **Fund Product Event Card** (new)
   - Specialized cards for NAV updates (valuation events)
   - Custom visualizations for distributions
   - Enhanced display for rebalance events
   - Special display for creation/redemption events

## Technical Implementation

The implementation follows a consistent pattern across all product types:

1. **Factory Pattern**: The `getProductSpecificEventCard` function in the `index.ts` file serves as a factory that returns the appropriate event card component based on the product type.

2. **Event Type Handling**: Each product-specific card implements special visualizations for the most common event types for that product, with fallback to a standard card design for other event types.

3. **Consistent Styling**: All cards maintain consistent styling with color-coded headers, icons, and status badges.

4. **Responsive Design**: All components are fully responsive and work well on various screen sizes.

## Usage

The product-specific event cards are automatically used by the `LifecycleEventCard` component when a product type is specified:

```jsx
<LifecycleEventCard 
  event={event}
  productType="bonds" // This will use BondProductEventCard for specific event types
  onEdit={handleEdit}
  onDelete={handleDelete}
/>
```

If no product-specific card is available for a given product type or event type, the system falls back to the default event card design.

## Future Enhancements

1. Implement event cards for additional product types:
   - Digital Tokenized Fund events
   - Stablecoin events
   - Commodity events
   - Private Equity/Debt events
   - Real Estate events

2. Add animation effects for status changes and transitions

3. Enhance the cards with interactive elements such as expandable details sections

4. Add support for related events (showing related events in a timeline)

5. Implement real-time updates with visual indicators for newly changed data
