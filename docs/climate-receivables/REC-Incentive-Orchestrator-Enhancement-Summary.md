## Configuration Options

```typescript
private readonly config = {
  batchSize: 50,                    // Items per batch
  maxRetries: 3,                    // Maximum retry attempts
  retryDelayMs: 1000,              // Base retry delay
  healthCheckIntervalMs: 30000,     // Health check frequency
  analyticsRefreshMs: 60000         // Analytics refresh interval
};
```

## Metrics Tracked

- **Total Operations**: Complete operation count
- **Success/Failure Rates**: Operation success tracking
- **Average Response Time**: Performance monitoring
- **Operation History**: Detailed history with timestamps
- **Health Status**: Component-level health tracking

## Alert Categories

1. **Low Completion Rate**: When REC-Incentive linking falls below thresholds
2. **Value Differentials**: Significant discrepancies between REC and incentive values
3. **Stale Records**: RECs pending for extended periods
4. **Performance Degradation**: System response time issues
5. **Database Connectivity**: Connection and query performance issues

## Usage Examples

### Batch Processing
```typescript
const orchestrator = RECIncentiveOrchestrator.getInstance();
const result = await orchestrator.batchCreateRECsWithIncentives(
  recDataArray,
  projectId,
  { 
    batchSize: 25, 
    continueOnError: true, 
    retryFailedItems: true 
  }
);
```

### Advanced Analytics
```typescript
const analytics = await orchestrator.getAdvancedRECIncentiveAnalytics(
  projectId,
  {
    includeForecasts: true,
    includeTrends: true,
    includeComparisons: true
  }
);
```

### Health Monitoring
```typescript
const health = orchestrator.getHealthStatus();
console.log(`System Status: ${health.status}`);
console.log(`Success Rate: ${health.metrics.successfulOperations / health.metrics.totalOperations * 100}%`);
```

### Export Reports
```typescript
const report = await orchestrator.exportAnalyticsReport(projectId, 'csv');
// Use report.data, report.filename, report.contentType for download
```

## Performance Improvements

1. **Database Efficiency**: Batch operations reduce database load
2. **Error Recovery**: Retry mechanisms prevent complete operation failures
3. **Memory Management**: Automatic cleanup prevents memory leaks
4. **Concurrent Processing**: Controlled concurrency optimizes throughput
5. **Health Monitoring**: Proactive issue detection and resolution

## Integration with Revised Implementation Plan

✅ **Batch Processing Only**: Removed all real-time dependencies
✅ **Free API Integration Ready**: Architecture supports integration with free APIs
✅ **In-Platform Reporting**: Comprehensive analytics and export capabilities
✅ **Enhanced Error Handling**: Robust error recovery and logging
✅ **Performance Monitoring**: Built-in health checks and metrics
