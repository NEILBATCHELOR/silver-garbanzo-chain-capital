# Market Data Electricity Price Fix

## Issue Summary
The Market Data Charts were displaying astronomical electricity prices like `$9483026511492651008/MWh` with unrealistic percentage changes of `+1923569573169318692.00%`.

## Root Cause
The `fetchEnergyMarketData` method in `FreeMarketDataService` was incorrectly converting EIA API sales **volume** data to electricity **price** data using an inappropriate formula:

```typescript
// WRONG: Converting sales volume to price
const electricityPrice = Math.round((salesValue / 1000000) * 100) / 100;
```

The EIA API returns total US electricity sales in millions of kWh, not price data. This resulted in astronomical numbers that were then amplified by historical data generation.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Realistic Pricing
