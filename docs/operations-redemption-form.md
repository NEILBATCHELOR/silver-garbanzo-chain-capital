## Overview
Created a simple operations redemption form that allows operations team members to create redemption requests for any investor without eligibility checks.

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files Created:
1. `/src/components/redemption/requests/OperationsRedemptionForm.tsx` - Main operations form component
2. `/src/pages/redemption/OperationsRedemptionPage.tsx` - Page wrapper for the operations form
3. `/src/components/redemption/requests/index.ts` - Export file for request components
4. `/src/pages/redemption/index.ts` - Export file for redemption pages

### Modified Files:
1. `/src/components/redemption/index.ts` - Added requests export
2. `/src/App.tsx` - Added route for operations redemption page

## Key Features

### Simple Operations Interface
- **No Eligibility Checks**: Form submits directly without any validation or eligibility checking
- **Token Amount**: Simple input with +/- buttons and percentage quick selection
- **Token Type**: Dropdown with all ERC standards, auto-populated from distribution
- **Wallet Addresses**: Source and destination wallet address inputs
- **Distribution Selection**: Dropdown showing all distributions for all investors

### Simplified Form Fields
- Distribution selection (all investors visible)
- Token amount with quick percentage buttons (25%, 50%, 75%, 100%)
- Token type (auto-populated from distribution standard)
- Redemption type (standard/interval)
- Conversion rate (token to USDC)
- Source wallet address (auto-populated from investor profile)
- Destination wallet address 
- Internal notes (optional)

### Key Differences from Original Form
- **No eligibility checking** - no `checkEligibility()` function calls
- **No restriction validation** - no lock-up period checks
- **All distributions visible** - not filtered by current user
- **Direct submission** - goes straight to approval queue
- **Operations focused** - internal notes instead of investor notes
