# Financial Products Lifecycle Management System Enhancements

## Overview

This implementation enhances the Financial Products Lifecycle Management System with:

1. **Product-Specific Event Cards** for all 15 financial product types
2. **Notification System** for upcoming lifecycle events

These improvements provide a more intuitive user experience and ensure timely action on critical events.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Product-Specific Event Cards

We've implemented specialized event cards for all financial product types, each with custom visualizations for their specific event types:

- **Structured Products**: Special handling for barrier events and coupon payments
- **Bonds**: Custom displays for coupon payments, maturity, and call events
- **Equity**: Specialized cards for dividends, stock splits, and valuation updates
- **Funds/ETFs/ETPs**: Enhanced displays for NAV updates, distributions, and rebalancing
- **Digital Tokenized Funds**: Special visualizations for token issuance, redemption, and upgrades
- **Stablecoins**: Custom cards for minting, burning, depeg events, and audits
- **Commodities**: Specialized displays for delivery, price updates, and contract rolls
- **Private Equity/Debt**: Enhanced cards for capital calls, distributions, and exits
- **Real Estate**: Custom visualizations for property acquisitions, sales, and rental income

Each card type provides:
- Visual differentiation based on event type
- Appropriate iconography and color coding
- Contextual information relevant to the specific event
- Standardized action buttons and status indicators

The implementation uses a factory pattern through the `getProductSpecificEventCard` function, which returns the appropriate component based on the product type.

### 2. Notification System

We've implemented a comprehensive notification system with:

- **Notification Service**: Identifies upcoming events that require attention
- **In-App Notifications**: Displays pending notifications with severity indicators
- **Email Notifications**: Sends customizable email alerts to team members
- **Calendar Integration**: Exports events to various calendar systems

Key features:

#### Notification Service
- Identifies events requiring attention
- Prioritizes events by type and timing
- Generates appropriate messages
- Creates calendar-compatible event objects

#### In-App Notifications
- Shows badge count of pending notifications
- Displays notifications in a dropdown panel
- Allows dismissing individual or all notifications
- Provides quick access to email and calendar actions

#### Email Notifications
- Multiple notification templates (standard, detailed, urgent)
- Recipient management
- Customizable subject and body
- Sending and tracking capabilities

#### Calendar Integration
- Support for multiple calendar types
- Customizable event details
- Reminder configuration
- ICS file generation for offline use

## Technical Architecture

The implementation follows a modular architecture with:

1. **Service Layer**:
   - `lifecycleNotificationService`: Manages notification logic
   - `lifecycleService`: Handles event CRUD operations

2. **Component Layer**:
   - Product-specific event cards
   - Notification UI components
   - Email and calendar integration components

3. **Integration Layer**:
   - Calendar format generation
   - Email template system
   - Real-time updates via Supabase

## Usage Examples

### Viewing Product-Specific Events

Users can view events in two formats:
- **Timeline View**: Chronological display of all events
- **Card View**: Grid of event cards with type-specific visualizations

The cards automatically adapt to show the most relevant information based on the product and event type.

### Managing Notifications

2. **Sending Emails**: Use the email dialog to send notifications to team members
3. **Calendar Export**: Add events to calendar systems for scheduling

   - Integration with external systems

## Conclusion

These enhancements significantly improve the user experience of the Financial Products Lifecycle Management System by providing:

1. More intuitive and informative visualizations through product-specific event cards
2. Proactive notification of upcoming events through multiple channels
3. Better integration with external systems through calendar exports and email notifications

The system now provides a comprehensive solution for managing the lifecycle of all 15 financial product types in a consistent and user-friendly manner.
