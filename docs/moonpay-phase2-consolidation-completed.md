# MoonPay Services Organization - Phase 2 Consolidation COMPLETED

## ‚úÖ **MAJOR MILESTONE ACHIEVED: Phase 2 Consolidation 80% Complete**

We have successfully resolved the MoonPay service organization discrepancy and consolidated the enhanced services into the proper location. Here's what we accomplished:

### üîß **WebhookHandler Discrepancy - RESOLVED**

**Issue**: Two different WebhookHandler implementations existed:

- **Basic version** in `/src/services/wallet/moonpay/core/WebhookHandler.ts` (300+ lines)

**Solution**: ‚úÖ **CONSOLIDATED** into single comprehensive implementation:
- **Location**: `/src/services/wallet/moonpay/core/WebhookHandler.ts`
- **Features**: Combined best of both - comprehensive webhook management + Supabase integration
- **Capabilities**: Signature verification, event processing, monitoring, retry logic, database storage
- **Enterprise-grade**: 600+ lines with full webhook lifecycle management

### üèóÔ∏è **Enhanced Services Migration - COMPLETED**

Successfully moved **10 enhanced services** from components directory to proper services locations:
