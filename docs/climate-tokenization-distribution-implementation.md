# Climate Receivables Tokenization & Distribution Implementation

## Overview

This implementation provides identical tokenization and distribution functionality to the factoring module, but specifically adapted for climate receivables. The implementation follows the exact same patterns and workflows established in the factoring module.

## Completed Components

### ðŸŽ¯ Core Managers
- **ClimateTokenizationManager** - Create and manage climate tokens from receivables pools
- **ClimateTokenDistributionManager** - Allocate and distribute climate tokens to investors

### ðŸ”§ Supporting Infrastructure
- **ClimateTokenDistributionHelpers** - UI helpers and navigation components
- **ClimateTokenDistributionTables** - Data tables for allocations, distributed tokens, and investors
- **ClimateTokenDistributionDialogs** - Create allocation dialogs
- **ClimateBulkEditAllocations** - Bulk operations for token allocations
- **useClimateTokenDistribution** - React hooks for data management

### ðŸš€ Navigation & Routing
- Added "Tokenization" and "Distribution" routes to ClimateReceivablesNavigation
- Updated ClimateReceivablesManager with new route handling
- Integrated components into existing navigation structure

## Key Features

### Climate-Specific Adaptations
- **Risk Assessment** - Climate tokens include risk scoring based on renewable energy factors
- **Weather Impact** - Integration with production variability for accurate valuations
- **Policy Risk** - Tracking of regulatory changes affecting renewable energy projects
- **Discount Rates** - Dynamic calculation based on risk profiles specific to climate assets

### Token Operations
- Create climate tokens from tokenization pools
- Set token standards (ERC-20, ERC-721, ERC-1155, ERC-1400, ERC-3525, ERC-4626)
- Calculate token values based on renewable energy receivables
- Track climate-specific metadata

### Distribution Management
- Allocate climate tokens to investors
- Support for both token-amount and investment-amount allocation modes
- Bulk operations for managing multiple allocations
- Track distribution status and transaction history

### Investment Features
- Calculate investment amounts with climate-specific discount rates
- Display risk profiles and expected returns
- Show renewable energy project details
- Support for wallet-based distribution

## Database Integration

Uses existing `tokens` table with climate-specific metadata:
```typescript
metadata: {
  climate: {
    source: 'climate_tokenization',
    pool_id: string,
    total_tokens: number,
    token_value: number,
    total_value: number,
    security_interest_details: string,
    status: string,
    average_risk_score: number,
    discounted_value: number,
    discount_amount: number,
    average_discount_rate: number,
    pool_name: string
  }
}
```

## Usage

Navigate to the Climate Receivables module and use:
- `/climate-receivables/tokenization` - Create and manage climate tokens
- `/climate-receivables/distribution` - Allocate and distribute tokens to investors

### Pattern Consistency
- Follows exact same component structure as factoring module
- Uses identical hook patterns and state management
- Maintains same UI/UX patterns for consistency
- Adapts functionality for climate-specific requirements

## Next Steps

The tokenization and distribution functionality is now complete and fully integrated. Users can:

1. **Create Climate Tokens**: Use the tokenization manager to create tokens from climate receivables pools
2. **Allocate to Investors**: Use the distribution manager to allocate tokens to investors
3. **Manage Distributions**: Track and manage token distributions with full transaction history
4. **Bulk Operations**: Perform bulk edits and operations on multiple allocations

This implementation provides a complete, production-ready tokenization and distribution system specifically designed for climate receivables while maintaining consistency with the existing factoring patterns.
