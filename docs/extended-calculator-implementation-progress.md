## Technical Architecture

### Base Calculator Integration
All extended calculators extend `BaseCalculator` and implement:
- `canHandle(input: CalculationInput): boolean`
- `getAssetTypes(): AssetType[]`
- `performCalculation(input: CalculationInput): Promise<NavServiceResult<CalculationResult>>`

### Common Design Patterns
1. **Modular Valuation Approaches:** Multiple valuation methods per calculator
2. **Risk-Adjusted NAV:** Comprehensive risk assessments integrated into valuations
3. **Market Data Integration:** External data source connectivity for pricing
4. **Scenario Analysis:** Monte Carlo and sensitivity analysis capabilities
5. **Regulatory Compliance:** Built-in compliance checks and reporting
6. **ESG Integration:** Environmental, social, and governance factor consideration

### Registry Integration
The `CalculatorRegistry` automatically discovers and registers all extended calculators, enabling:
- Dynamic calculator selection based on asset type
- Fallback to composite fund calculator for unsupported types
- Performance monitoring and error handling
- A/B testing capabilities for calculator improvements

## Implementation Quality Standards

### Code Quality Metrics
- **TypeScript Coverage:** 100% strict typing
- **Line Count Limit:** Each calculator under 1000 lines
- **Error Handling:** Comprehensive try-catch blocks with structured error responses
- **Documentation:** Extensive JSDoc comments and inline documentation

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for each calculation method
- Integration tests with mock data sources
- Stress testing with extreme market scenarios
- Performance benchmarking for large portfolios

### Performance Considerations
- Asynchronous calculation processing
- Efficient decimal arithmetic using Decimal.js
- Caching strategies for external data sources
- Memory optimization for large dataset processing

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priorities
1. **StructuredProductCalculator** - High complexity derivatives and structured notes
2. **ClimateReceivablesCalculator** - ESG-focused climate instruments

### Development Schedule
- **Week 1-2:** StructuredProductCalculator implementation
- **Week 3:** ClimateReceivablesCalculator implementation  
- **Week 4:** CollectiblesCalculator and InvoiceReceivablesCalculator
- **Week 5:** Integration testing and performance optimization

### Integration Requirements
- Update `AssetType` enum with any missing types
- Enhance `CalculatorRegistry` for advanced routing logic
- Implement comprehensive logging and monitoring
