# Aggressive Anti-Duplication Solution for Product Lifecycle Events

## Problem

Despite previous attempts to fix the issue, duplicate records were still being created in both the UI and database when adding events to the Product Lifecycle Management timeline. This indicated a deeper issue that required a more comprehensive approach.

## Comprehensive Solution

We implemented an aggressive, multi-layered solution that addresses the issue at multiple levels:

### 1. Frontend Form Submission Protection

- **Added unique submission IDs** using UUID to track each form submission
- **Implemented a dual-lock mechanism** with both state and refs to prevent double-submissions
- **Made form dialogs impossible to close** during submission to prevent user actions
- **Added cleanup hooks** to ensure proper state reset when components unmount

### 2. Client-Side Deduplication with Debounce Pattern

- **Created a global event memory** that persists across component mounts
- **Implemented a smart debounce pattern** that detects and merges duplicate event creation calls
- **Added deterministic event hashing** based on key fields to identify duplicates
- **Intelligent promise reuse** to ensure only one network request per logical event

### 3. Service-Layer Duplicate Detection

- **Enhanced duplicate detection** with fuzzy numeric matching for quantities
- **Extended the lookback window** to catch duplicates from slow networks
- **Improved matching algorithm** to handle null/undefined/empty string cases
- **Added robust error handling** to prevent failures from blocking creation

### 4. Database-Level Constraints

- **Created a database migration** to add a trigger that prevents duplicates
- **Implemented a server-side function** to check for duplicates within a 5-second window
- **Added a cleanup function** to purge existing duplicates from the database
- **Established more robust error handling** for duplicate detection on the server

### 5. Enhanced Debugging and Monitoring

- **Added detailed logging** throughout the submission flow
- **Improved error messages** to help identify the source of duplicates
- **Added metadata to events** for better tracking and debugging

## Technical Implementation Details

1. **Event Metadata**
   - Each event now includes submission IDs and timestamps
   - Transaction hash field is used for deduplication when not provided by user

2. **Debounce Pattern**
   - Using a Map to store recent event creation calls
   - Reusing promises for identical events
   - Automatically cleaning up old entries to prevent memory leaks

3. **Database Protection**
   - Added a trigger function that runs before each insert
   - Checks for similar events within a 5-second window
   - Throws an exception if a duplicate is detected

4. **UI Improvements**
   - Better feedback during submission
   - Prevents dialog closure during submission
   - More explicit state management for form submissions

## Files Modified

1. `/frontend/src/components/products/lifecycle/lifecycle-event-form.tsx`
   - Added UUID for submission tracking
   - Implemented submission locks and cleanup
   - Added metadata to event submissions

2. `/frontend/src/components/products/lifecycle/product-lifecycle-manager.tsx`
   - Improved dialog behavior during submission
   - Better state management for form handling

3. `/frontend/src/services/products/productLifecycleService.ts`
   - Implemented debounced event creation
   - Separated implementation from public API
   - Enhanced duplicate detection logic

4. `/frontend/src/utils/debounceCreateEvent.ts` (new file)
   - Implemented global event memory and debounce pattern
   - Added deterministic event hashing for deduplication

5. `/backend/migrations/20250817_prevent_duplicate_lifecycle_events.sql` (new file)
   - Database-level protections against duplicates
   - Added trigger function and cleanup utilities

6. `/frontend/src/types/products/productTypes.ts`
   - Extended interface definitions to include metadata

## Testing

This aggressive solution has been tested for:
- Multiple rapid submissions
- Network failures and retries
- Browser refreshes during submission
- UI and database consistency

This solution prevents duplicates at multiple levels, ensuring data integrity regardless of user actions or network conditions.
