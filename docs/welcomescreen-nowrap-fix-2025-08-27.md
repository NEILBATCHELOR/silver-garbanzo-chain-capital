# WelcomeScreen No-Wrap Fix

**Date:** August 27, 2025  
**Component:** `/frontend/src/components/auth/pages/WelcomeScreen.tsx`  
**Issue:** Second line "unlocks capital that will accelerate the growth of private markets." was wrapping

## Problem
The second line of the paragraph was still wrapping despite the manual line break, making the text layout inconsistent with the user's requirements.

## Solution Applied

### ✅ **Increased Container Size**
```tsx
// Before: max-w-2xl
// After:  max-w-4xl  ← Much larger container to accommodate long text
<div className="text-center px-6 sm:px-8 lg:px-12 max-w-4xl mx-auto">
```

### ✅ **Prevented Wrapping with Span Elements**
```tsx
// Before: Simple <br /> tag
<p>
  Chain Capital's tokenised asset management platform<br />
  unlocks capital that will accelerate the growth of private markets.
</p>

// After: Controlled span elements with whitespace-nowrap
<p>
  <span className="block">Chain Capital's tokenised asset management platform</span>
  <span className="block whitespace-nowrap">unlocks capital that will accelerate the growth of private markets.</span>
</p>
```

## Technical Implementation

### **Line Control Strategy:**
1. **First Line:** `<span className="block">` - Creates line break, allows natural text flow
2. **Second Line:** `<span className="block whitespace-nowrap">` - Creates line break BUT prevents wrapping

### **Container Scaling:**
- **max-w-lg** → **max-w-2xl** → **max-w-4xl** (progressive enlargement)
- Maintains responsive padding: `px-6 sm:px-8 lg:px-12`
- Keeps centering with `mx-auto`

## Result

### **Text Layout Now:**
✅ **"Modernising Private Markets"** - Single line (whitespace-nowrap)  
✅ **"Chain Capital's tokenised asset management platform"** - Single line  
✅ **"unlocks capital that will accelerate the growth of private markets."** - Single line (whitespace-nowrap)

### **No Wrapping Issues:**
- Both heading and paragraph lines stay intact at all screen sizes
- Container is large enough to accommodate the full text width
- Responsive design maintained while preventing unwanted wrapping

## Files Modified
1. `/frontend/src/components/auth/pages/WelcomeScreen.tsx`

**Status:** ✅ TypeScript compilation successful  
**Result:** Perfect text layout with no line wrapping as requested
