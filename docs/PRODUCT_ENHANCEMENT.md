## Integration with Projects

The product functionality is integrated into the project details page, with a new "Product Details" tab that displays product-specific information or allows adding new product details.

## Database Schema

The implementation leverages the existing database tables:
- `structured_products`
- `equity_products`
- `commodities_products`
- `fund_products`
- `bond_products`
- `private_equity_products`
- `private_debt_products`
- `real_estate_products`
- `energy_products`
- `infrastructure_products`
- `collectibles_products`
- `asset_backed_products`
- `stablecoin_products`
- `product_lifecycle_events`

## Usage

1. Create a project with a specific project type (e.g. "equity")
2. Navigate to the project details page
3. Select the "Product Details" tab
4. Add product-specific details using the appropriate form
5. View and manage product lifecycle events

## Future Enhancements

- Implement product-specific analytics and reports
- Add workflow automation based on product lifecycle stages
- Implement advanced search and filtering based on product attributes
- Add document templates specific to each product type
- Enhance lifecycle event management with notifications and triggers
