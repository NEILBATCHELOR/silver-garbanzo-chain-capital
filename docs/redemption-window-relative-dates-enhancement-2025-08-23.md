# Redemption Window Relative Dates Enhancement

**Date**: August 23, 2025  
**Feature**: Enhanced redemption window system with flexible date configuration  
**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED - Full implementation with database, service, and UI enhancements

## üéØ Enhancement Summary

### Problem Addressed
The original redemption window system only supported **fixed calendar dates** for submission and processing periods. This approach didn't work well for interval funds where redemption windows should be tied to **token issuance/distribution dates** rather than arbitrary calendar dates.

### Solution Implemented
Enhanced the redemption system to support **both fixed dates and relative dates** with flexible configuration options:

**a) Submission Date Alternatives:**
- **Fixed Dates**: Traditional calendar date selection
- **Days After Issuance**: Relative to token distribution date
  - `0 days` = Same day as token distribution
  - `90 days` = 90-day lockup period after distribution
  - `30 days` = Monthly redemption cycles
  - Any number of days for custom lockup periods

**b) Processing Date Alternatives:**
- **Fixed Dates**: Specific calendar dates for processing
- **Same Day**: Process on the submission date
- **Offset Days**: Process N days after submission period ends
  - `+1 day` = Process the day after submission closes
  - `+3 days` = Process 3 days after submission closes

## ‚úÖ Implementation Details

### 1. Database Schema Enhancements

**New Columns Added to `redemption_windows`:**
```sql
submission_date_mode: submission_date_mode_enum ('fixed', 'relative')
processing_date_mode: processing_date_mode_enum ('fixed', 'same_day', 'offset')
lockup_days: INTEGER (days after issuance for redemption availability)
processing_offset_days: INTEGER (days after submission for processing)
```

**New Enum Types:**
```sql
submission_date_mode_enum: ('fixed', 'relative')
processing_date_mode_enum: ('fixed', 'same_day', 'offset')
```

**Data Validation Constraints:**
- `lockup_days >= 0` (cannot have negative lockup)
- `processing_offset_days >= 0` (cannot have negative offset)
- Performance indexes on new columns

### 2. Enhanced TypeScript Types

**New Types in `redemption.ts`:**
```typescript
export type SubmissionDateMode = 'fixed' | 'relative';
export type ProcessingDateMode = 'fixed' | 'same_day' | 'offset';

export interface RedemptionWindow {
  // Date Configuration Modes
  submission_date_mode: SubmissionDateMode;
  processing_date_mode: ProcessingDateMode;
  
  // Relative Date Settings
  lockup_days?: number;
  processing_offset_days?: number;
  
  // ... existing fields
}
```

### 3. Enhanced Service Layer

**New Service: `EnhancedRedemptionService`**
- `createRedemptionWindow()` with relative date support
- `getRedemptionWindows()` with enhanced filtering
- `calculateWindowDatesForDistribution()` for date calculations
- `getProjectDistributions()` for multi-window support

**Key Features:**
- Automatic date calculation for relative mode
- Support for multiple redemption windows per project
- Integration with `distributions` table for issuance dates
- Backward compatibility with existing fixed date windows

### 4. Enhanced User Interface

**New Component: `EnhancedRedemptionWindowManager`**
- **Radio button selection** for date modes
- **Visual configuration cards** for each option
- **Real-time form updates** based on selected mode
- **Smart validation** based on configuration
- **Enhanced window display** showing date mode information

**UI Features:**
- Clear visual indicators for date mode (Fixed vs Relative vs Offset)
- Contextual help text explaining each option
- Form fields that show/hide based on selected mode
- Enhanced window cards showing configuration summary

## üöÄ Business Benefits

### For Service Providers
- **Flexible Configuration**: Choose between fixed calendar dates or relative dates based on use case
- **Automated Lockup Periods**: Set 90-day lockups that automatically apply to all token distributions
- **Reduced Manual Work**: No need to manually calculate dates for each distribution
- **Consistent Application**: Same rules apply to all investors regardless of when they received tokens

### For Interval Funds
- **Rolling Redemptions**: Each token distribution creates its own redemption timeline
- **Fair Treatment**: All investors get same lockup period regardless of distribution date  
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Structured redemption periods that meet interval fund requirements
- **Operational Efficiency**: Automated processing schedules reduce administrative overhead

### For Investors  
- **Clear Expectations**: Know exactly when redemptions become available after receiving tokens
- **Fair Access**: Equal treatment regardless of distribution timing
- **Predictable Schedule**: Consistent lockup and processing periods

## üìä Usage Examples

### Example 1: 90-Day Lockup with Next-Day Processing
```
Configuration:
- Submission Date Mode: "Relative" 
- Lockup Days: 90
- Processing Date Mode: "Offset"
- Processing Offset Days: 1

Result:
- Investor receives tokens on Jan 1st
- Redemption submissions open: April 1st (90 days later)
- Processing begins: April 2nd (1 day after submission window)
```

### Example 2: Immediate Redemption with Same-Day Processing  
```
Configuration:
- Submission Date Mode: "Relative"
- Lockup Days: 0  
- Processing Date Mode: "Same Day"

Result:
- Investor receives tokens on Jan 1st
- Redemption available: Jan 1st (same day)
- Processing: Jan 1st (same day as submission)
```

### Example 3: Fixed Calendar Schedule
```
Configuration:
- Submission Date Mode: "Fixed"
- Submission Dates: March 1-15, 2025
- Processing Date Mode: "Fixed" 
- Processing Dates: March 16-17, 2025

Result:
- All investors (regardless of distribution date) can submit: March 1-15
- All redemptions processed: March 16-17
```
