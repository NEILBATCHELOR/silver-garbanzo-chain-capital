# ERC-1400 Security Token Configuration - Implementation Complete

## Overview

The ERC-1400 token configuration has been fully implemented with comprehensive coverage of all 119 database fields and related tables. This implementation provides enterprise-grade security token functionality with institutional-level features.

## Architecture

### Base + Sub-forms Structure

The implementation follows a modular architecture with:
- **Base Form**: Core token properties (ERC1400BaseForm.tsx)
- **Properties Form**: Advanced token features (ERC1400PropertiesForm.tsx)  
- **Related Table Forms**: Management of associated data entities

### Database Coverage

#### Main Properties Table (119 fields)
- `token_erc1400_properties` - Complete implementation of all boolean, text, numeric, and JSONB fields
- Fields include institutional features, compliance monitoring, governance, corporate actions, etc.

#### Related Tables (10 additional tables)
All related tables now have dedicated management forms:

1. **token_erc1400_partitions** → ERC1400PartitionsForm.tsx
2. **token_erc1400_controllers** → ERC1400ControllersForm.tsx
3. **token_erc1400_documents** → ERC1400DocumentsForm.tsx
4. **token_erc1400_corporate_actions** → ERC1400CorporateActionsManagementForm.tsx ✨ NEW
5. **token_erc1400_custody_providers** → ERC1400CustodyProvidersForm.tsx ✨ NEW
6. **token_erc1400_regulatory_filings** → ERC1400RegulatoryFilingsForm.tsx ✨ NEW
7. **token_erc1400_partition_operators** → ERC1400PartitionOperatorsForm.tsx ✨ NEW
8. **token_erc1400_partition_balances** - (Managed programmatically - runtime data)
9. **token_erc1400_partition_transfers** - (Transaction history - read-only audit trail)

✅ **100% Coverage**: All configurable tables have management interfaces
