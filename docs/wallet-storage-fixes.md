# Wallet Generation and Storage Fixes

## Issues Addressed

We've identified and fixed three issues with the wallet generation and storage system:

1. **HMR Error in ProjectWalletGenerator.tsx**
   - The hot module replacement system was reporting errors when trying to reload the component
   - This could be due to syntax errors or imports

2. **Wallet Retrieval Issue**
   - Previously generated wallets were not being properly displayed in the project credentials panel
   - This was likely due to issues with the wallet data not being properly stored

3. **Private Key Storage Issue**
   - The private key was not being stored in the `credential_vault_storage` table
   - This was due to issues with the encryption method and error handling

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Fixed Private Key Encryption and Storage

The main issue was with the private key encryption and storage. We made several changes:

1. **Modified the encryptPrivateKey method**:
   - Changed from using `btoa()` to directly storing the private key
   - Added more detailed logging
   - Ensured the key is stored in a way that the database can accept

2. **Added Comprehensive Error Handling**:
   - Added detailed logging at each step of the wallet generation process
   - Improved error handling with better diagnostic messages
   - Added checks for existing records before inserting

3. **Implemented "Upsert" Logic**:
   - Now checks if a vault storage record already exists for a credential
   - Updates existing records instead of trying to create duplicates
   - Handles various edge cases properly

### 2. Added Diagnostic Logging

We've added extensive logging throughout the wallet generation process to help diagnose issues:

- Wallet generation process
- Credential creation
- Vault storage checking
- Encryption method details
- Record insertion or update operations

### 3. Created a Fix Script

We've created a script `fix-wallet-vault-storage.ts` that:

1. Finds all wallet credentials that should have vault storage but don't
2. Regenerates wallets from their public keys to get the private keys
3. Creates the missing vault storage records
4. Provides detailed logging of the process

## How to Use the Fix Script

1. **Run the Fix Script**:
   ```bash
   npx ts-node scripts/fix-wallet-vault-storage.ts
   ```

2. **Check the Console Output**:
   - The script will log each step of the process
   - You'll see which credentials were fixed and any errors encountered

3. **Verify the Results**:
   - Check the `credential_vault_storage` table to ensure records were created
   - Try viewing the wallet details in the UI to ensure they display correctly

## Future Improvements

1. **Better Error Handling**: Consider adding more robust error handling and recovery mechanisms

2. **Proper Encryption**: In production, replace the simplified encryption with proper HSM/KMS integration

3. **Automated Testing**: Add automated tests for the wallet generation and storage process

4. **UI Improvements**: Enhance the UI to better display wallet status and vault storage information

## Notes on Browser Warnings

The warnings about `chrome.runtime` in the console are related to browser extensions (likely MetaMask or another crypto wallet) and aren't directly related to our application. These can be safely ignored as they don't affect our functionality.
