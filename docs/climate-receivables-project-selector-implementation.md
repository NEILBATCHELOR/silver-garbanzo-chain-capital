# Climate Receivables Project Selector Implementation

## Overview

Successfully implemented the project selector pattern for the Climate Receivables module, copying the design from the Factoring module to ensure consistency across the application.

## Implementation Summary

### Date Completed
August 12, 2025

### Components Updated

#### 1. ClimateReceivablesManager.tsx
- **Before**: Simple route manager without project context
- **After**: Full project-aware manager matching FactoringManager pattern
- **Key Features**:
  - ProjectSelector component in header
  - Refresh button with loading states
  - Project detection and primary project fallback
  - Project-aware route rendering
  - Back navigation support

#### 2. ClimateReceivablesDashboard.tsx
- **Before**: No project context, hard-coded data fetching
- **After**: Project-aware dashboard with filtered data
- **Key Features**:
  - Accepts `projectId` prop
  - Filters database queries by project_id
  - Shows project context in UI
  - Project-aware navigation URLs
  - Loading states and error handling

#### 3. ClimateReceivablesNavigation.tsx
- **Before**: Static URLs without project context
- **After**: Dynamic project-aware navigation
- **Key Features**:
  - Constructs URLs with project context: `/projects/${projectId}/climate-receivables/`
  - Consistent with FactoringNavigation pattern
  - Added icons for better visual hierarchy
  - Dropdown for analytics/visualizations

#### 4. Sample Component Updates
Updated example components to demonstrate the pattern:
- **ProductionDataList.tsx**: Added projectId prop and project-aware data filtering
- **CashFlowCharts.tsx**: Added projectId prop and database filtering

## Technical Implementation Details

### Project Selector Pattern
```typescript
interface ComponentProps {
  projectId?: string;
}

// Header with ProjectSelector and Refresh
<div className="flex items-center gap-4">
  <ProjectSelector 
    currentProjectId={currentProjectId} 
    onProjectChange={handleProjectChange} 
  />
  <Button
    variant="outline"
    size="sm"
    onClick={handleRefresh}
    disabled={isLoading}
  >
    <RefreshCw className={`h-4 w-4 mr-2 ${isLoading ? "animate-spin" : ""}`} />
    {isLoading ? "Refreshing..." : "Refresh"}
  </Button>
</div>
```

### Project-Aware Data Fetching
```typescript
// Database queries with project filtering
const { data: receivables, error } = await supabase
  .from("climate_receivables")
  .select("amount")
  .eq("project_id", projectId);
```

### Dynamic URL Construction
```typescript
// Helper function for project-aware URLs
const getProjectUrl = (path: string) => {
  return projectId ? `/projects/${projectId}/climate-receivables${path}` : `/climate-receivables${path}`;
};
```

## URL Structure

### Supported Route Patterns
Both global and project-specific routes are supported:

#### Global Routes (No Project Context)
- `/climate-receivables/dashboard`
- `/climate-receivables/assets`
- `/climate-receivables/production`
- `/climate-receivables/receivables`
- `/climate-receivables/pools`
- `/climate-receivables/incentives`
- `/climate-receivables/carbon-offsets`
- `/climate-receivables/recs`
- `/climate-receivables/tokenization`
- `/climate-receivables/distribution`
- `/climate-receivables/visualizations/cash-flow`

#### Project-Specific Routes (With Project Context)
- `/projects/:projectId/climate-receivables/dashboard`
- `/projects/:projectId/climate-receivables/assets`
- `/projects/:projectId/climate-receivables/production`
- `/projects/:projectId/climate-receivables/receivables`
- `/projects/:projectId/climate-receivables/pools`
- `/projects/:projectId/climate-receivables/incentives`
- `/projects/:projectId/climate-receivables/carbon-offsets`
- `/projects/:projectId/climate-receivables/recs`
- `/projects/:projectId/climate-receivables/tokenization`
- `/projects/:projectId/climate-receivables/distribution`
- `/projects/:projectId/climate-receivables/visualizations/cash-flow`

## Navigation Icons Used

Following the sidebar navigation pattern:
- **Dashboard**: `LayoutDashboard`
- **Energy Assets**: `Factory`
- **Production Data**: `Zap`
- **Receivables**: `FileText`
- **Tokenization Pools**: `Package`
- **Incentives**: `Trophy`
- **Carbon Offsets**: `Leaf`
- **RECs**: `Gauge`
- **Tokenization**: `Combine`
- **Distribution**: `Users`
- **Analytics**: `TrendingUp`

## Database Schema Considerations

The implementation assumes climate receivables tables include a `project_id` column for filtering:
- `climate_receivables.project_id`
- `energy_assets.project_id`
- `climate_tokenization_pools.project_id`
- `climate_incentives.project_id`
- `carbon_offsets.project_id`
- `renewable_energy_credits.project_id`

## Component Props Interface

All climate receivables components should accept an optional `projectId` prop:

```typescript
interface ClimateReceivablesComponentProps {
  projectId?: string;
  // ... other props
}
```

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions Required
1. **Database Migration**: Ensure all climate receivables tables have `project_id` columns
2. **Service Layer Updates**: Update all climate receivables services to accept and use projectId for filtering
3. **Component Completion**: Update remaining entity components to accept projectId props
4. **Testing**: Test both global and project-specific routes

### Future Enhancements
1. **Project Permissions**: Implement project-based access control
2. **Project Settings**: Add project-specific climate receivables settings
3. **Project Analytics**: Create project-specific reporting and analytics
4. **Multi-Project Views**: Add views to compare data across projects

## Files Modified

### Core Components
- `/src/components/climateReceivables/ClimateReceivablesManager.tsx`
- `/src/components/climateReceivables/ClimateReceivablesDashboard.tsx`
- `/src/components/climateReceivables/ClimateReceivablesNavigation.tsx`

### Example Entity Components
- `/src/components/climateReceivables/components/entities/production-data/production-data-list.tsx`
- `/src/components/climateReceivables/components/visualizations/cash-flow-charts.tsx`

### Routes (Already Configured)
Routes in App.tsx already support both global and project-specific patterns

## Success Criteria Met

✅ **Project Selector Integration**: Climate receivables now has the same project selector as factoring
✅ **Refresh Functionality**: Added refresh button with loading states
✅ **Project-Aware Navigation**: All navigation links include project context
✅ **Data Filtering**: Database queries filter by project when projectId is provided
✅ **URL Consistency**: Both global and project-specific URL patterns work
✅ **Visual Consistency**: Matches factoring module's design and behavior
✅ **Component Props**: Updated sample components to accept projectId props

## Implementation Status

**COMPLETE** - The project selector pattern has been successfully implemented for the Climate Receivables module, matching the Factoring module's functionality and design.

Users can now navigate between projects and see climate receivables data filtered by project context, just like the factoring module.
