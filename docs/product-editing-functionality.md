# Product Editing Functionality

This implementation adds the ability to edit product information after it's been added to the system.

## Overview

The product editing functionality enhances the existing product management system by allowing users to modify product details after creation. This feature is crucial for keeping product information up-to-date as terms and conditions change over time.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Edit Button in Product Details View

Added an "Edit" button to the ProductDetails component that triggers edit mode:

```tsx
<Button variant="outline" size="sm" onClick={onEdit}>
  <Edit className="h-4 w-4 mr-2" />
  Edit
</Button>
```

### 2. Edit Mode State Management

Implemented state management in the ProjectDetailsPage component to handle switching between view and edit modes:

- Added `isEditMode` state variable
- Added handlers for edit, cancel, and save actions
- Modified rendering logic to show the appropriate component based on the current mode

### 3. Leveraging Existing Components

The implementation leverages existing components and their capabilities:

- **ProductForm.tsx**: Already supported both creation and editing modes
- **ProductFactoryService.ts**: Already had the `updateProduct` method implemented
- **BaseProductForm.tsx**: Already supported cancel functionality

### 4. User Flow

1. User navigates to the Product Details tab for a project
2. User clicks the "Edit" button to enter edit mode
3. The form is pre-populated with the existing product data
4. User makes changes and clicks "Save" to update the product
5. User can click "Cancel" to discard changes and return to view mode

## Components Modified

1. **ProductDetails.tsx**
   - Added Edit button
   - Added onEdit prop to allow parent components to handle edit requests

2. **ProjectDetailsPage.tsx**
   - Added isEditMode state
   - Added handleEditProduct and handleCancelEdit functions
   - Updated rendering logic for product tab content
   - Connected edit functionality to ProductDetails and ProductForm components

## Future Enhancements

1. **Field-level validation**: Add more sophisticated validation for product-specific fields
2. **Audit trail**: Track changes made to products over time
3. **Permissions**: Add role-based permissions for editing products
4. **Confirmation dialog**: Add confirmation before discarding changes
5. **Partial updates**: Allow updating only modified fields to reduce database load

## Testing

Test the product editing functionality with various product types to ensure:
- Form pre-population works correctly
- All field types (text, number, date, etc.) can be edited properly
- Validation works as expected
- Save and cancel operations function correctly
