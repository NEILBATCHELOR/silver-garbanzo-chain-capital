# Financial Products Database Implementation

This implementation provides a comprehensive database schema and TypeScript interfaces for managing 15 different financial product categories with specific terms and lifecycle management features.

## Overview

The implementation supports the following product categories:

### Traditional Assets
- Structured Products
- Equity
- Commodities
- Funds, ETFs, ETPs
- Bonds
- Quantitative Investment Strategies

### Alternative Assets
- Private Equity
- Private Debt
- Real Estate
- Energy
- Infrastructure
- Collectibles & Other Assets
- Asset Backed Securities / Receivables
- Solar and Wind Energy, Climate Receivables

### Digital Assets
- Digital Tokenized Fund
- Stablecoins (various types)
  - Fiat-Backed Stablecoin
  - Crypto-Backed Stablecoin
  - Commodity-Backed Stablecoin
  - Algorithmic Stablecoin
  - Rebasing Stablecoin

## Implementation Components

### 1. Database Schema

The SQL migration script `20250816_product_fields_enhancement.sql` provides:

- Enhanced table structures for all 15 product types
- New enum types for standardization (product_status, stablecoin_collateral_type)
- Addition of missing fields from the specification document
- Creation of a dedicated stablecoin collateral table
- Performance indexes for efficient querying
- Documentation comments for maintainability

### 2. TypeScript Interfaces

The implementation includes two sets of TypeScript interfaces:

1. **Base Interfaces** (`productTypes.ts`): 
   - Core fields and essential properties for each product type
   - Compatible with existing codebase

2. **Enhanced Interfaces** (`enhancedProducts.ts`):
   - Comprehensive implementation with all fields from the specification
   - Extended properties for more detailed product management
   - Additional service interfaces for lifecycle management

## Field Categorization

Each product type's fields are categorized as:

- **Terms**: Contractual features, specifications, and characteristics
- **Lifecycle**: Events and stages the asset goes through (issuance, trading, redemption, etc.)

## Type System Architecture

The TypeScript interfaces follow a hierarchical structure:

1. `BaseProduct`: Common fields for all products
2. Product-specific interfaces: Fields specific to each product type
3. Enhanced interfaces: Extended versions with additional fields
4. Union types for polymorphic operations

## Usage Examples

### Creating a New Product

```typescript
import { ProductServiceInterface, EnhancedStructuredProduct } from '../types/products';

// Example of creating a new structured product
const createStructuredProduct = async (
  productService: ProductServiceInterface<EnhancedStructuredProduct>,
  projectId: string
) => {
  const newProduct: Omit<EnhancedStructuredProduct, 'id' | 'createdAt' | 'updatedAt'> = {
    projectId,
    productName: "Capital Protected Note on S&P 500",
    issuer: "Investment Bank XYZ",
    underlyingAssets: ["S&P 500 Index"],
    payoffStructure: "capital_protected",
    barrierLevel: 80,
    couponRate: 4.5,
    protectionLevel: 100,
    currency: "USD",
    nominalAmount: 1000000,
    issueDate: new Date("2025-09-01"),
    maturityDate: new Date("2028-09-01"),
    status: "Active",
    // Enhanced fields
    targetAudience: "Conservative investors seeking capital protection",
    distributionStrategy: "Private placement through wealth management",
    riskRating: 3,
    complexFeatures: {
      participationRate: 65,
      airbagFeature: true
    }
  };
  
  return await productService.create(newProduct);
};
```

### Recording a Lifecycle Event

```typescript
import { EnhancedProductLifecycleServiceInterface, EnhancedCreateLifecycleEventRequest, LifecycleEventType } from '../types/products';

// Example of recording a coupon payment event
const recordCouponPayment = async (
  lifecycleService: EnhancedProductLifecycleServiceInterface,
  productId: string
) => {
  const event: EnhancedCreateLifecycleEventRequest = {
    productId,
    productType: "structured_products",
    eventType: LifecycleEventType.COUPON_PAYMENT,
    quantity: 45000, // $45,000 coupon payment
    actor: "System",
    details: "Regular coupon payment of 4.5% on nominal amount",
    valueChange: 45000,
    complianceChecks: {
      taxWithheld: 0,
      regulatoryReporting: "completed"
    }
  };
  
  return await lifecycleService.createEvent(event);
};
```

## Key Features

* **Type-specific forms and views**: Each product type has its own dedicated form and detail view
* **Factory pattern**: The system uses a factory pattern to create the appropriate service for each product type
* **Lifecycle management**: Products can track lifecycle events specific to their type
* **Consistent formatting**: Utility functions ensure consistent data presentation

## Next Steps

1. Expand the implementation with more detailed forms for the remaining product types
2. Add product lifecycle event visualization and management
3. Implement product-specific analytics and reporting
4. Enhance the UI with more interactive features

The implementation is modular and extensible, making it easy to add new product types or enhance existing ones as requirements evolve.
