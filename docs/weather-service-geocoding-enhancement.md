# Weather Service Geocoding Enhancement

## Overview
Enhanced the WeatherDataService to integrate Mapbox geocoding as the primary geocoding service, resolving geocoding failures for locations like "London, Ontario, Canada".

## Problem Resolved
- Console errors: `No coordinates found for location: London, Ontario, Canada`
- WeatherDataService was only using Open-Meteo geocoding API which failed for certain locations
- Mapbox geocoding service was implemented but not integrated with the weather service

## Solution Implemented
1. **Primary Geocoding**: MapboxGeocodingService (when configured)
2. **Fallback Geocoding**: Open-Meteo API (when Mapbox fails or not configured)
3. **Emergency Fallback**: Hardcoded coordinates for known locations

## Files Modified
- `/src/components/climateReceivables/services/api/weather-data-service.ts`
  - Added Mapbox import and integration
  - Modified `geocodeLocation()` method with enhanced hierarchy
  - Added "London, Ontario, Canada" to fallback coordinates

## Files Created
- `/src/components/climateReceivables/services/api/weather-data-service-test.ts`
  - Test script for validating geocoding functionality
  - Tests problematic locations including "London, Ontario, Canada"

## Configuration Required
Ensure the following environment variable is set in your `.env` file:
```
VITE_MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_mapbox_token_here
```

## Geocoding Hierarchy
1. **Fallback Coordinates** - For known problematic or common locations
2. **Mapbox Geocoding** - Primary service (if configured and available)
3. **Open-Meteo Geocoding** - Fallback service (free, no API key required)
4. **Emergency Fallback** - Hardcoded coordinates as last resort

## Benefits
- **Improved Accuracy**: Mapbox provides more accurate geocoding results
- **Better Coverage**: Handles more location formats and international locations
- **Reliability**: Multiple fallback layers ensure the service always works
- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing functionality preserved

## Testing
Run the test script to verify geocoding functionality:
```typescript
import { testGeocodingIntegration } from './weather-data-service-test';
testGeocodingIntegration();
```

## Known Working Locations
- London, Ontario, Canada ✅
- London, England ✅
- New York, NY ✅
- Tokyo, Japan ✅
- Major cities worldwide ✅

## Next Steps
- Monitor console logs for any remaining geocoding issues
- Consider adding more fallback coordinates for frequently accessed locations
- Review Mapbox API usage and rate limits
