# Climate Receivables Module Type Fix

This update resolves TypeScript errors in the Climate Receivables module by establishing consistent type definitions and fixing property naming inconsistencies.

## Issues Fixed

1. **Type Definition Consistency**
   - Created separate database (DB) and UI type interfaces
   - Added consistent naming conventions (snake_case for DB, camelCase for UI)
   - Added proper conversion functions between DB and UI types

2. **Property Naming**
   - Fixed mismatches between DB fields (snake_case) and TypeScript interfaces (camelCase)
   - Added helper functions to consistently transform between different representation formats

3. **Form Integration**
   - Fixed form state types to properly match component props
   - Corrected date handling in form submissions
   - Fixed calculation issues in numeric fields

4. **Type Conversions**
   - Added proper type conversion between database response and UI models
   - Fixed issues with nested objects and arrays

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Type Definitions

- Created separate `*DB` interfaces for database operations
- Enhanced UI interfaces with proper camelCase properties
- Added conversion helper functions (`dbToUi*`) for each entity type

### 2. Fixed Service Implementation

- Updated service to use proper type conversions
- Fixed issues with object property access
- Corrected type casting

### 3. Fixed Form Components

- Updated form validation schemas
- Fixed date handling and parsing
- Removed fields not present in form state types
- Corrected calculation logic for derived fields

## Key Components Fixed

1. **Types**
   - Added complete type definitions with proper naming conventions
   - Created conversion helpers

2. **Climate Receivables Service**
   - Updated type imports
   - Fixed return type casting
   - Implemented proper DB to UI conversion

3. **Incentive Form**
   - Fixed date handling
   - Updated form schema
   - Fixed form submission

4. **REC Form**
   - Fixed calculation logic
   - Updated form schema
   - Fixed type issues in submission

5. **Energy Assets Create**
   - Removed fields not in form state
   - Fixed form validation schema
   - Corrected form initialization

## Best Practices Implemented

- **Consistent Naming**: Followed project naming conventions:
  - snake_case for database fields
  - camelCase for TypeScript/UI code
  - PascalCase for types and interfaces

- **Type Safety**: Enhanced type safety with explicit type conversions

- **Form Handling**: Improved React Hook Form integration with proper types

- **Code Organization**: Maintained clear separation between database and UI models
