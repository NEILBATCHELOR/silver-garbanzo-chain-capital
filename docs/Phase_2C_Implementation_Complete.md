const [marketData, setMarketData] = useState<MarketDataSnapshot | null>(null);
const [userDataSources, setUserDataSources] = useState<UserDataSource[]>([]);
const [policyAlerts, setPolicyAlerts] = useState<PolicyChange[]>([]);

// Market data indicators calculation
const getMarketDataIndicators = (): MarketDataIndicator[] => {
  // Treasury rates, credit spreads, energy prices analysis
  // Impact assessment on risk calculations
  // Trend analysis and risk impact determination
};
```

2. **Policy Alert Integration:**
```typescript
// Policy change monitoring with impact assessment
const relevantPolicyChanges = marketDataSnapshot.policy_changes.filter(
  policy => policy.impact_on_receivables !== 0
);
```

3. **Data Quality Metrics:**
```typescript
interface DataQualityMetrics {
  user_data_sources: number;
  market_data_freshness: number;
  coverage_percentage: number;
  confidence_boost: number;
}
```

### **Data Quality Dashboard Architecture:**

```typescript
interface DataQualityScore {
  overall_score: number;        // Weighted composite (0-100)

  freshness_score: number;      // Data freshness (0-100)  
  accuracy_score: number;       // Processing accuracy (0-100)
  coverage_score: number;       // Coverage completeness (0-100)
}

interface DataSourceHealth {
  source_type: string;          // 'market_apis' | 'user_data'
  source_name: string;          // Display name
  status: 'healthy' | 'warning' | 'error' | 'offline';
  last_updated: string;         // ISO timestamp
  success_rate: number;         // Percentage (0-100)
  error_count: number;          // Error count
}
```
