# Project Dialog UI Enhancements

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive UI enhancements made to the ProjectDialog component to improve user experience and interface design.

## Changes Made

### 1. Tab Navigation Fixed

- Fixed issue where Key Dates and Documents tabs were not selectable
- Properly tied tab selection to the `activeTab` state
- Maintained the reset to "Basic Information" tab whenever the dialog opens

### 2. Project Type Dropdown Redesign

- Completely redesigned the project type dropdown with a more modern and consistent appearance
- Added colored category headers with distinct visual separation:
  - Traditional Assets (blue)
  - Alternative Assets (orange)
  - Digital Assets (purple)
- Enhanced readability with improved typography and spacing:
  - Better font size hierarchy (labels vs descriptions)
  - Increased padding for more comfortable reading
  - Added subtle borders between items
- Improved focus states for better accessibility
- **Fixed display issue**: Now only the project type label is shown in the trigger field after selection, not the description

### 3. Dropdown Consistency

- Standardized all dropdown components with consistent styling:
  - Added full width to all SelectTriggers
  - Increased padding on SelectItems for better touch targets
  - Improved focus and hover states
- Enhanced the currency dropdown with a sticky search input

### 4. Visual Hierarchy

- Used color coding to create a clear category structure
- Applied proper spacing to create visual breathing room
- Used font weights and sizes to distinguish between primary and secondary text

## Implementation Details

1. **Project Type Dropdown**
   - Added colored category headers with more distinct styling
   - Improved item styling with borders and padding
   - Enhanced focus states for better keyboard navigation
   - Created a helper function `getProjectTypeLabel` to display only the label in the trigger field
   - Restructured the SelectItem contents to prevent passing both label and description to SelectValue

2. **Other Dropdowns**
   - Added consistent padding to all SelectItems
   - Made the currency search input sticky at the top of the dropdown
   - Added proper formatting to currency items

3. **Tab Navigation**
   - Fixed tab selection by properly using the activeTab state
   - Kept the reset behavior on dialog open

## Future Improvements

Potential future enhancements could include:
- Creating a more responsive layout for mobile devices
- Implementing form field persistence across tab switches
- Adding validation for financial fields (e.g., minimum values for monetary amounts)
- Implementing autocomplete for jurisdiction and currency fields
- Adding tooltips to explain complex fields
- Implementing better keyboard navigation between tabs
