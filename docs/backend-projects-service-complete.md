## 💡 Why Fastify Schema Instead of TypeBox

**Decision**: We use **Fastify's built-in JSON schema validation** rather than TypeBox because:

1. **Performance**: Fastify's native validation is faster (2x+ vs Express)
2. **Integration**: Deep integration with Fastify's request/response cycle
3. **Simplicity**: No additional dependencies required
4. **OpenAPI**: Schemas automatically generate Swagger documentation
5. **Ecosystem**: Rich plugin ecosystem with built-in rate limiting, CORS, auth

## 🔧 Usage Examples

### Basic Project Creation
```typescript
import { ProjectService } from '@/services/projects'

const projectService = new ProjectService()

const result = await projectService.createProject({
  name: "TechCorp Series A",
  projectType: "equity",
  targetRaise: 5000000,
  authorizedShares: 1000000,
  sharePrice: 5.00,
  legalEntity: "TechCorp Inc.",
  jurisdiction: "Delaware",
  votingRights: "common",
  dividendPolicy: "discretionary"
}, true) // createCapTable = true

if (result.success) {
  console.log('Project created:', result.data.project.id)
}
```

### Advanced Analytics
```typescript
import { ProjectAnalyticsService } from '@/services/projects'

const analyticsService = new ProjectAnalyticsService()
const analytics = await analyticsService.getProjectAnalytics(projectId)

if (analytics.success) {
  console.log('Total raised:', analytics.data.summary.totalRaised)
  console.log('Target completion:', analytics.data.summary.targetCompletion)
}
```

## 🏁 Next Steps
