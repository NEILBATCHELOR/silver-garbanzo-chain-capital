# Current State Detailed Analysis - Chain Capital Architecture Transition

## Executive Summary

This document provides a detailed analysis of the current Chain Capital codebase and outlines the systematic process for transitioning from centralized to domain-local dependency architecture. **We are continuing from Phase 1 implementation, where analysis is complete and we're ready to begin domain structure creation.**

## Current Architecture Problems Identified

### 1. Massive Central Types File
- **File:** `src/types/centralModels.ts` 
- **Size:** 35KB (1,000+ lines)
- **Problem:** Contains ALL domain types mixed together
- **Impact:** 
  - All domains tightly coupled to this single file
  - Merge conflicts when multiple developers work on types
  - Difficult to understand domain boundaries
  - Circular dependency risks

### 2. Centralized Component Organization
- **Current Structure:** `src/components/[domain]/`
- **Domains Identified:** auth, captable, compliance, dashboard, documents, investors, projects, tokens, wallet, redemption, reports, activity, admin
- **Problem:** All components under single directory despite domain separation
- **Impact:**
  - No clear domain ownership
  - Cross-domain imports are easy and uncontrolled
  - Difficult to test domains in isolation

### 3. Centralized Services Organization  
- **Current Structure:** `src/services/[domain]/`
- **Problem:** Similar to components - centralized despite domain folders
- **Impact:**
  - Business logic not properly encapsulated by domain
  - Services can easily import across domains

### 4. Mixed Architecture Patterns
- **Monorepo Structure:** `packages/` directory exists but mostly empty
- **Centralized Structure:** All active code in `src/`
- **Problem:** Confusion between patterns, incomplete migration
- **Impact:** 
  - Developers unsure which pattern to follow
  - Inconsistent import paths
  - Some packages exist but aren't used

## Systematic Process for Dependency Analysis

This is my methodology to analyze each file and its dependencies to ensure the codebase doesn't break during migration:

### Phase 1: Static Code Analysis
```bash
# 1. Map all TypeScript files and their imports/exports
# 2. Build dependency graph showing relationships
# 3. Identify circular dependencies before moving anything
# 4. Categorize files by domain and shared components
```

### Phase 2: Impact Assessment
```bash
# 1. For each file to be moved, identify ALL files that import it
# 2. Create impact matrices showing cascade effects
# 3. Prioritize moves based on impact (low impact first)
# 4. Plan import path updates for each move
```

### Phase 3: Migration Planning
```bash
# 1. Create migration order based on dependency analysis
# 2. Group related files for atomic moves
# 3. Plan rollback strategies for each step
# 4. Create validation scripts to test each step
```

### Phase 4: Execution with Validation
```bash
# 1. Move files in planned order
# 2. Update imports systematically
# 3. Run TypeScript compilation after each step
# 4. Run automated tests to verify functionality
```

## Detailed Current State Analysis

### Domain Boundary Analysis

Based on code analysis, here are the identified domains with their current centralized dependencies:

#### 1. **Auth Domain** (Foundation - No Dependencies)
- **Current Location:** `src/components/auth/`, `src/services/auth/`
- **Types in centralModels:** User, UserRole, UserStatus, AuthSession
- **Dependencies:** None (should be moved first)
- **Files to Move:** ~15 components, 5 services, multiple hooks

#### 2. **Investor Domain** (Depends on Auth)
- **Current Location:** `src/components/investors/`, `src/services/investor/`
- **Types in centralModels:** Investor, InvestorEntityType, KycStatus, AccreditationStatus, InvestorApproval
- **Dependencies:** Auth (user context)
- **Files to Move:** ~25 components, 8 services, investor onboarding flows

#### 3. **Project Domain** (Depends on Auth)
- **Current Location:** `src/components/projects/`, `src/services/project/`
- **Types in centralModels:** Project, ProjectStatus, ProjectType, Organization
- **Dependencies:** Auth (ownership)
- **Files to Move:** ~20 components, 6 services, project management

#### 4. **Token Domain** (Depends on Project, Auth)
- **Current Location:** `src/components/tokens/`, `src/services/token/`
- **Types in centralModels:** Token, TokenStandard, TokenStatus, Token[ERC]*Properties
- **Dependencies:** Project (token-project relationship), Auth
- **Files to Move:** ~40 components (many ERC standards), 15 services

#### 5. **Captable Domain** (Depends on Investor, Project, Token)
- **Current Location:** `src/components/captable/`, `src/services/captable/`
- **Types in centralModels:** Subscription, TokenAllocation, Distribution
- **Dependencies:** Investor, Project, Token (ownership data)
- **Files to Move:** ~15 components, 5 services

#### 6. **Compliance Domain** (Depends on Investor, Document)
- **Current Location:** `src/components/compliance/`, `src/services/compliance/`
- **Types in centralModels:** ComplianceStatus, ApprovalStatus, ApprovalType
- **Dependencies:** Investor (compliance checks), Document (verification)
- **Files to Move:** ~30 components, 10 services (complex workflows)

#### 7. **Document Domain** (Serves Multiple Domains)
- **Current Location:** `src/components/documents/`, `src/services/document/`
- **Types in centralModels:** IssuerDocument, InvestorDocument, DocumentStatus
- **Dependencies:** Project, Investor, Compliance (document ownership)
- **Files to Move:** ~12 components, 4 services

#### 8. **Wallet Domain** (Depends on Auth)
- **Current Location:** `src/components/wallet/`, `src/services/wallet/`
- **Types in centralModels:** Wallet, WalletType, Transaction, MultiSigTransaction
- **Dependencies:** Auth (wallet ownership)
- **Files to Move:** ~20 components, 8 services (blockchain integration)

#### 9. **Redemption Domain** (Depends on Token, Investor, Captable)
- **Current Location:** `src/components/redemption/`, `src/services/redemption/`
- **Types in centralModels:** RedemptionRequest, RedemptionWindow, Approver
- **Dependencies:** Token, Investor, Captable (redemption data)
- **Files to Move:** ~10 components, 4 services

#### 10. **Reporting Domain** (Depends on All - Read Only)

- **Types in centralModels:** ActivityLog, Invoice, WorkflowStage
- **Dependencies:** All other domains (data aggregation)
- **Files to Move:** ~8 components, 3 services

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### High-Risk Areas
1. **Circular Dependencies:** Token â†” Project, Investor â†” Compliance
2. **Shared Types:** BaseModel, Address, shared enums used across domains
3. **Database Integration:** All domains use centralized database types
4. **Web3 Integration:** Wallet and Token domains share blockchain utilities

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Gradual Migration:** Move one domain at a time, starting with Auth (no dependencies)
2. **Shared Abstractions:** Create interfaces for cross-domain communication
3. **Event-Driven Architecture:** Use events instead of direct imports for complex relationships
4. **Comprehensive Testing:** Validate each step with automated tests
5. **Rollback Plans:** Maintain ability to revert each migration step

## Current Status: Ready for Phase 1 Implementation

Based on the analysis in my memory and the current codebase examination:

âœ… **Analysis Phase Complete** (100%)
- Domain boundaries identified and documented  
- Centralized dependencies mapped
- Risk assessment completed
- Migration strategy defined

ðŸ”„ **Phase 1: Domain Structure Creation** (0% - Ready to Start)
- **Next Task:** Task 1.1 - Create Domain Directory Structure
- **Priority:** High
- **Estimated Time:** 2-3 weeks
- **Safe to Begin:** Yes - no breaking changes in structure creation

## Recommended Immediate Actions

### Week 1: Foundation Setup
1. **Create Feature-Based Directory Structure**
   ```
   src/features/
   â”œâ”€â”€ auth/
   â”œâ”€â”€ investors/  
   â”œâ”€â”€ projects/
   â”œâ”€â”€ tokens/
   â”œâ”€â”€ captable/
   â”œâ”€â”€ compliance/
   â”œâ”€â”€ documents/
   â”œâ”€â”€ wallet/
   â”œâ”€â”€ redemption/
   â””â”€â”€ reporting/
   ```

2. **Begin with Auth Domain** (No dependencies - safest to start)
3. **Set up Progress Tracking** and validation scripts
4. **Establish Development Guidelines** for new architecture

### Week 2-3: Type System Restructuring  
1. **Extract Auth Types** from centralModels.ts
2. **Create Domain-Specific Type Files**
3. **Update Import Paths** systematically
4. **Test and Validate** each domain extraction

## Success Metrics for Phase 1

- [ ] Domain directory structure created without breaking existing functionality
- [ ] Clear domain boundaries established and documented  
- [ ] Team understands new architectural patterns
- [ ] No development velocity impact during transition
- [ ] All existing imports continue to work (no breaking changes)
