# Project Dialog Enhancements

## Overview

This document outlines the enhancements made to the ProjectDialog component to improve user experience and interface design.

## Changes Made

### 1. Default Tab Selection

- Set "Basic Information" as the default tab when opening the dialog for both new and existing projects
- Added a useEffect to ensure the active tab is reset to "Basic Information" whenever the dialog opens
- Removed the redundant `defaultValue` prop from the Tabs component since we're controlling it with state

### 2. Product Type Dropdown Styling

- Enhanced the styling of the product type dropdown for better readability and visual consistency
- Added proper padding and margin to dropdown items
- Improved focus states for better accessibility and visual feedback
- Ensured all dropdown items have consistent width and alignment
- Added better visual hierarchy between the label and description text

## Implementation Details

1. Added an explicit width to the SelectTrigger component
2. Enhanced the styling of SelectItem components with:
   - Full width container (w-full)
   - Consistent padding (py-1)
   - Better spacing between label and description (mt-0.5)
   - Improved focus states (focus:bg-primary/5 focus:text-primary)

## Database Schema Verification

Verified that the projects table has all necessary fields for the Basic Information tab:
- name (text)
- description (text)
- status (character varying)
- project_type (text)
- investment_status (character varying)
- is_primary (boolean)

Fields that were previously missing for the Key Dates tab and other form sections have been added via a migration script (`20250816_add_project_fields.sql`):

### Newly Added Fields
- subscription_start_date (DATE)
- subscription_end_date (DATE)
- transaction_start_date (DATE)
- maturity_date (DATE)
- total_notional (NUMERIC)
- authorized_shares (NUMERIC)
- share_price (NUMERIC)
- company_valuation (NUMERIC)
- minimum_investment (NUMERIC)
- estimated_yield_percentage (NUMERIC)
- token_symbol (TEXT)
- legal_entity (TEXT)
- jurisdiction (TEXT)
- tax_id (TEXT)
- duration (TEXT)
- currency (TEXT)

## Future Improvements

Potential future enhancements could include:
- Creating a more responsive layout for mobile devices
- Implementing form field persistence across tab switches
- Adding validation for financial fields (e.g., minimum values for monetary amounts)
- Implementing autocomplete for jurisdiction and currency fields
- Adding tooltips to explain complex fields
