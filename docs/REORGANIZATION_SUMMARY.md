- Import Statements:     3661 found for review
- Empty Directories: Cleaned up

## Next Steps

1. **Review TypeScript Issues**: Check typescript-check.log for any compilation issues
2. **Test Application**: Run the application and test key functionality
3. **Update Documentation**: Update any documentation that references old folder structure
4. **Team Communication**: Inform team members about new folder structure

## Rollback Instructions

If issues occur, you can rollback using the backup:
```bash
rm -rf src
mv backup-TIMESTAMP src
