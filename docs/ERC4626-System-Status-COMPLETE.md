### **Deploy Advanced Vault (Right Now)**
```typescript
import { unifiedERC4626DeploymentService } from './unifiedERC4626DeploymentService';

// Deploy with automatic optimization
const result = await unifiedERC4626DeploymentService.deployERC4626Token(
  tokenId,
  userId,
  projectId,
  {
    useOptimization: true,
    enableAnalytics: true,
    enableValidation: true
  }
);

console.log(`Strategy: ${result.deploymentStrategy}`); // 'basic', 'enhanced', or 'chunked'
console.log(`Gas saved: ${result.gasOptimization?.estimatedSavings} wei`);
```

### **Automatic Routing via Main Service**
```typescript
import { unifiedTokenDeploymentService } from './unifiedTokenDeploymentService';

// Main service automatically detects advanced ERC4626 features
const result = await unifiedTokenDeploymentService.deployToken(tokenId, userId, projectId);
// Routes to specialist service automatically for advanced features
```
