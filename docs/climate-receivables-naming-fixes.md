# Climate Receivables Naming Convention Fixes

## Summary

Fixed systematic naming convention issues across the Climate Receivables module where components were using snake_case property names instead of camelCase properties defined in the TypeScript interfaces.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Form Components
- **climate-receivable-form.tsx**
  - Updated Zod schema field names from snake_case to camelCase
  - Fixed form field references (asset_id → assetId, payer_id → payerId, etc.)
  - Corrected form submission data transformation
  - Fixed payer data initialization with correct property names

### 2. List Components  
- **climate-receivables-list.tsx**
  - Fixed table row rendering with correct property references
  - Updated payer comparison logic in unique filtering
  - Corrected dropdown menu actions with proper ID references
  - Fixed delete function to use camelCase property names

### 3. Service Layer
- **cash-flow-forecasting-service.ts**
  - Updated receivable property references (due_date → dueDate)
  - Fixed incentive property mappings (expected_receipt_date → expectedReceiptDate)
  - Corrected projection object creation with camelCase properties
  - Fixed sorting and aggregation logic

- **risk-assessment-service.ts**
  - Updated risk factor property references (production_risk → productionRisk)
  - Fixed payer property mappings (financial_health_score → financialHealthScore)
  - Corrected policy impact calculations (impact_level → impactLevel)

- **tokenization-service.ts**
  - Fixed risk score references throughout the service
  - Updated pool property mappings (total_value → totalValue)
  - Corrected token properties creation with camelCase

- **climateReceivablesService.ts**
  - Added missing EnergyAssetType import
  - Fixed type casting for energy asset type property

### 4. Type System
- **Missing Imports Fixed**
  - Added EnergyAssetType import to production-data-form.tsx
  - Fixed missing type imports across REC and incentive components

### 5. Data Handling
- **REC Form Calculations**
  - Fixed arithmetic operations by ensuring proper number conversion
  - Added type safety for quantity and price calculations

- **Date Handling**
  - Fixed date parsing in incentive forms with proper type casting
  - Ensured Date constructor receives valid input types

- **WeatherData Type Matching**
  - Fixed partial weather data assignment in production forms
  - Created proper WeatherData objects with required fields

### 6. UI Components
- **LineChart Integration**
  - Updated energy assets detail chart usage to match component interface
  - Added fallback display for empty data states

10. `/frontend/src/components/climateReceivables/components/entities/energy-assets/energy-assets-detail.tsx`

## Remaining Issues

Based on the original error list, the following may still need attention:

1. **Missing Type Exports**: Some components still reference types that may not be properly exported from the types index file
2. **Service Integration**: The services may need to be tested to ensure proper data transformation between UI types and database types
3. **Form Validation**: Additional form validation may be needed for the corrected field names
4. **Error Handling**: Error handling in async operations should be reviewed

## Next Steps

1. Test all forms to ensure proper data submission
2. Verify list components display data correctly
3. Test service layer operations with the database
4. Review any remaining TypeScript compilation errors
5. Test component interactions and navigation

## Notes

- All changes maintain the project's naming convention standards (camelCase for TypeScript/JavaScript, snake_case for database)
- The types file already had proper conversion functions between database and UI types
- Service layer properly transforms data between camelCase UI types and snake_case database types
