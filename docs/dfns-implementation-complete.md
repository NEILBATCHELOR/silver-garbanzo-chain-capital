## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### **Service Integration Pattern**
```typescript
// All components follow this real integration pattern
const dfnsService = await initializeDfnsService();
const authStatus = dfnsService.getAuthenticationStatus();

if (authStatus.isAuthenticated) {
  const data = await dfnsService.getWalletService().getAllWallets();
  // Use real data throughout
}
```

### **User Action Signing Pattern**  
```typescript
// Enterprise security with User Action Signing
const wallet = await dfnsService.createWallet(
  network,
  name,
  undefined // User Action Token handled internally
);
```

### **Comprehensive Error Handling**
```typescript
catch (error: any) {
  if (error.message.includes('User action required')) {
    setError('User Action Signing required. Please complete authentication.');
  } else if (error.message.includes('Invalid or expired token')) {
    setError('Authentication token expired. Please refresh your DFNS session.');
  } else {
    setError(`Operation failed: ${error.message}`);
  }
}
```
