# Property Naming Inconsistency Fix

## Issue Overview

This fix addresses TypeScript errors caused by inconsistent property naming conventions between database schema (snake_case) and TypeScript interfaces (camelCase) in the Climate Receivables module.

## Changes Made

### 1. In `climate-receivable-detail.tsx`:
- Changed property access to use snake_case where appropriate:
  - Changed `impact.impactId` to `impact.impact_id`
  - Changed `impact.policyId` to `impact.policy_id`
  - Changed `impact.impactDescription` to `impact.impact_description`

### 2. In `climate-receivable-form.tsx`:
- Updated mock data to match interface definitions:
  - Changed `asset_id` to `assetId` in `EnergyAsset` objects
  - Changed `paymentHistory` to `payment_history` in `ClimatePayer` objects
- Fixed form submission to use consistent property names:
  - Changed camelCase property access to use snake_case in the form state
  - Updated asset lookup logic to use proper property names
  - Updated form value access to match the database schema

### 3. In `climate-receivables-list.tsx`:
- Fixed array reduction logic to use correct property names:
  - Changed `asset.asset_id` to `asset.assetId`
  - Updated UI components to use consistent property names

## Root Cause

The inconsistency stemmed from:
1. Database schema properly using snake_case (PostgreSQL convention)
2. Some TypeScript interfaces using camelCase (JavaScript convention)
3. Other TypeScript interfaces using snake_case
4. Components mixing both conventions

## Future Recommendations

For a more comprehensive solution:
1. Standardize all TypeScript interfaces to use camelCase
2. Implement a transformation layer that converts between snake_case (database) and camelCase (application) 
3. Use a consistent approach for all entity types

This would simplify development and reduce the risk of similar errors in the future.
