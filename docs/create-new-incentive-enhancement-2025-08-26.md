# Climate Incentives Create New Incentive Enhancement

## Overview
Enhanced the "Create New Incentive" form to provide dropdown selectors populated from database tables instead of free text inputs for Asset ID and Receivable ID fields.

## Implementation Date
August 26, 2025

## URL
http://localhost:5173/projects/{projectId}/climate-receivables/incentives

## Problem Solved
Previously, users had to manually enter Asset ID and Receivable ID as free text, which could lead to errors and made it difficult to link incentives to existing assets and receivables.

## Enhancement Details

### Before
- Asset ID: Free text input
- Receivable ID: Free text input

### After
- **Energy Asset (Optional)**: Dropdown selector populated from `energy_assets` table
  - Shows: `Name - Type (Location) - Capacity MW`
  - Stores: `asset_id` UUID in database
  - Option for "None - No asset linkage"

- **Climate Receivable (Optional)**: Dropdown selector populated from `climate_receivables` table
  - Shows: `$Amount - Due: Date (Risk: Score)`
  - Stores: `receivable_id` UUID in database
  - Option for "None - No receivable linkage"

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified
- `/frontend/src/components/climateReceivables/pages/IncentiveForm.tsx`

### Key Changes
1. **Added Imports**:
   - `energyAssetsService` from `../services/energyAssetsService`
   - `climateReceivablesService` from `../services/climateReceivablesService`
   - `EnergyAsset`, `ClimateReceivable` types

2. **Added State Management**:
   ```typescript
   const [assets, setAssets] = useState<EnergyAsset[]>([]);
   const [receivables, setReceivables] = useState<ClimateReceivable[]>([]);
   const [loadingAssets, setLoadingAssets] = useState(true);
   const [loadingReceivables, setLoadingReceivables] = useState(true);
   ```

3. **Added Data Loading**:
   - `loadAssets()` - Fetches from `energyAssetsService.getAll()`
   - `loadReceivables()` - Fetches from `climateReceivablesService.getAll()`
   - Both called on component mount via `useEffect`

4. **Enhanced UI Components**:
   - Replaced text inputs with `Select` components
   - Added formatted display names for better user experience
   - Maintained optional nature with "None" options
   - Added loading states

### Display Formatting
```typescript
// Energy Asset Display
const formatAssetDisplayName = (asset: EnergyAsset) => {
  return `${asset.name} - ${asset.type} (${asset.location}) - ${asset.capacity}MW`;
};

// Climate Receivable Display  
const formatReceivableDisplayName = (receivable: ClimateReceivable) => {
  const amount = new Intl.NumberFormat('en-US', {
    style: 'currency',
    currency: 'USD'
  }).format(receivable.amount);
  return `${amount} - Due: ${new Date(receivable.dueDate).toLocaleDateString()} (Risk: ${receivable.riskScore})`;
};
```

## Database Schema
The enhancement works with existing schema:

### `climate_incentives` table:
- `asset_id`: UUID (nullable) - Foreign key to energy_assets.asset_id
- `receivable_id`: UUID (nullable) - Foreign key to climate_receivables.receivable_id

### `energy_assets` table:
- `asset_id`: UUID (primary key)
- `name`: VARCHAR
- `type`: VARCHAR  
- `location`: VARCHAR
- `capacity`: NUMERIC

### `climate_receivables` table:
- `receivable_id`: UUID (primary key)
- `amount`: NUMERIC
- `due_date`: DATE
- `risk_score`: INTEGER

## User Experience Improvements
1. **Reduced Errors**: No manual UUID entry required
2. **Better Context**: Users see meaningful asset/receivable information
3. **Optional Linking**: Can leave unlinked if not applicable
4. **Loading States**: Visual feedback while data loads
5. **Searchable Dropdowns**: Large lists are searchable via Select component

## Business Impact
- Eliminates data entry errors for asset/receivable linkage
- Improves data consistency and relationship integrity
- Enhances user workflow for incentive management
- Provides better visibility into existing assets and receivables

## Testing
- ✅ Form loads with dropdown options populated from database
- ✅ Both fields remain optional with "None" selection
- ✅ Form submission works with selected UUIDs
- ✅ Edit mode populates current selections correctly
- ✅ Loading states display while fetching data

## Next Steps
1. Apply database migration if not already done
2. Test with production data
3. Monitor performance with large datasets
4. Consider pagination for dropdowns if needed
5. Add search/filter functionality for large lists if required
