   - Status: Always completed (required to exist)

2. **Eligibility Validation**
   - Entity: GuardianPolicyEnforcement
   - Description: KYC/AML and compliance validation
   - Status: Completed when status moves beyond 'pending'

3. **Multi-Signature Approval**
   - Entity: MultiSigApprovers
   - Description: 2-of-3 signature approval process
   - Status: Completed when status reaches 'processing' or 'settled'

4. **Token Burning & Settlement**
   - Entity: GuardianWallet
   - Description: Token burn and fund settlement execution
   - Status: Completed when status reaches 'settled'

5. **Settlement Confirmation**
   - Entity: Blockchain
   - Description: Transaction confirmed on blockchain
   - Status: Completed when status is 'settled'

## Integration Points

### Existing Hooks
- Uses existing `useRedemptions` hook for data
- Maintains compatibility with current filtering system
- Integrates with notification system

### Navigation
- Clicking status cards navigates to requests tab with filters applied
- View details button navigates to request management
- Timeline items link to detailed views

### Responsive Design
- Mobile-first responsive grid layouts
- Collapsible sections for smaller screens
- Touch-friendly interactive elements

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Additions
1. **Real-time Progress Updates**: WebSocket integration for live stage updates

3. **Detailed Entity Actions**: Drill-down into specific entity activities
4. **Custom Filtering**: Advanced filters by entity, date range, value
5. **Export Capabilities**: Export workflow data and timelines

### Performance Optimizations
