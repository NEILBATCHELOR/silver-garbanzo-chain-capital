# Climate Receivables Module Implementation

## Current Progress

- [x] Created database schema for Climate Receivables module
- [x] Defined TypeScript interfaces matching the database schema
- [x] Implemented core components (navigation, dashboard, manager)
- [x] Created key entity management components (Energy Assets, Carbon Offsets)
- [x] Implemented business logic services for risk assessment, cash flow, weather analysis, and tokenization
- [x] Added initial form components for data entry

## Database Schema

The database schema includes tables for:

- Energy assets (solar farms, wind turbines)
- Production data linked to weather conditions
- Receivables from utilities and customers
- Financial incentives (tax credits, RECs, subsidies)
- Carbon offsets with verification standards
- Renewable energy credits with market types
- Tokenization pools for investment
- Risk assessment factors

## TypeScript Interfaces

Created comprehensive TypeScript interfaces that:

- Match the database schema with proper naming conventions
- Include enum types for all categorical fields
- Define relationships between entities
- Include form state types for UI components
- Support both read and insert operations

## Core Components

Implemented the main structural components:

- **ClimateReceivablesNavigation**: Side navigation with access to all module features
- **ClimateReceivablesDashboard**: Dashboard with key metrics and visualizations
- **ClimateReceivablesManager**: Main router component for managing all routes

## Entity Management

Created components for managing key entities:

- **Energy Assets**: List view, create form, and detailed view
- **Carbon Offsets**: List view with filtering capabilities

## Business Logic

Implemented services for core business logic:

- **RiskAssessmentService**: Calculates risk scores and discount rates
- **CashFlowForecastingService**: Predicts future cash flows from receivables and incentives
- **WeatherProductionService**: Analyzes correlation between weather and energy production
- **TokenizationService**: Manages tokenization of climate receivables

## Form Components

Created form components for data entry:

- **ClimateReceivableForm**: Form for creating and editing climate receivables

## Next Steps

1. Complete remaining entity management components:
   - Production Data management
   - Incentives tracking
   - RECs management
   - Tokenization Pools

2. Add more form components:
   - Carbon Offset Form
   - REC Form
   - Tokenization Pool Form

3. Create data visualization components:
   - Cash Flow Charts
   - Risk Assessment Dashboards
   - Weather Impact Analysis

4. Implement API integration:
   - Supabase database integration
   - External weather data APIs
   - Carbon market price APIs

## Integration Plan

To integrate the Climate Receivables module with the main application:

1. Add the main route to the application router:
   ```jsx
   <Route path="/climate-receivables/*" element={<ClimateReceivablesManager />} />
   ```

2. Link to the module from the main navigation or dashboard:
   ```jsx
   <NavigationItem 
     icon={<Leaf />}
     label="Climate Finance"
     href="/climate-receivables"
   />
   ```

3. Ensure the Supabase database schema is updated with the new tables

4. Add permission checks for accessing the module features
