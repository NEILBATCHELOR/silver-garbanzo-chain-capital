### Incentives Tracking (Newly Implemented)

1. **Incentives List**
   - Displays a table of all incentives
   - Shows types, amounts, statuses, and expected receipt dates
   - Includes summary statistics (total amount, pending amount, received amount)
   - Supports filtering by type, status, and expected receipt date
   - Provides actions for viewing, editing, and deleting incentives

2. **Incentive Detail**
   - Shows comprehensive information about an incentive
   - Includes tabs for overview, related entities, and status tracking
   - Displays related asset and receivable information
   - Visualizes status progression with a timeline and progress indicator
   - Provides options to edit or delete the incentive

3. **Incentive Form**
   - Supports both creation and editing of incentives
   - Includes fields for type, amount, status, and expected receipt date
   - Features dropdowns for selecting related assets and receivables
   - Includes validation for all fields
   - Handles form submission and error states

4. **Supabase API Integration**
   - Complete CRUD operations for incentives
   - Proper error handling and loading states
   - Joins with related entities (assets, receivables)
   - Support for filtering and sorting

## Current Status

- [x] Created database schema for Climate Receivables module
- [x] Defined TypeScript interfaces matching the database schema

- [x] Created key entity management components:
  - [x] Energy Assets (previously implemented)
  - [x] Carbon Offsets (previously implemented)
  - [x] Production Data (previously implemented)
  - [x] Climate Receivables (previously implemented)
  - [x] Incentives (newly implemented)
- [x] Implemented business logic services:
  - [x] Risk assessment
  - [x] Cash flow forecasting
  - [x] Weather analysis
  - [x] Tokenization
  - [x] Incentives management
- [x] Added form components:
  - [x] Climate Receivable Form (previously implemented)
  - [x] Production Data Form (previously implemented)
  - [x] Incentives Form (newly implemented)
- [x] Implemented API services:
  - [x] Production Data Service (previously implemented)
  - [x] Climate Receivables Service (previously implemented)
  - [x] Incentives Service (newly implemented)

## Next Steps

1. Continue with the remaining entity management components:
   - RECs management
   - Tokenization Pools

2. Implement additional form components:
   - Carbon Offset Form
   - REC Form
   - Tokenization Pool Form

3. Create data visualization components:
   - Cash Flow Charts
   - Risk Assessment Dashboards
   - Weather Impact Analysis

4. Complete API integration:
   - External weather data APIs
   - Carbon market price APIs

## Technical Decisions and Architecture

### Component Design

The Incentives components follow the established three-part structure:
- **List**: For viewing and filtering collections of incentives
- **Detail**: For examining a single incentive in depth
- **Form**: For creating and editing incentives

This pattern ensures a consistent user experience across the module and will be applied to the remaining entity types.

### Status Tracking

The Incentive Detail component features a visual status tracking system:
- Progress bar showing the current stage in the incentive lifecycle
- Timeline view with checkpoints for each status
- Visual indicators for completed, current, and future statuses
- Time remaining calculation for expected receipt dates

### Related Entity Integration

The Incentive components integrate with both assets and receivables:
- Dropdowns in the form for selecting related entities
- Detailed information about related entities in the detail view
- Links to navigate to the related entity details

### Service Layer

The Incentives Service handles all API calls to Supabase, following the same pattern as the other services:
- Centralizes data transformation logic
- Provides CRUD operations and specialized queries
- Handles error cases consistently

## Improvements and Features

Some notable features in the Incentives implementation:

1. **Summary Statistics**: The list view includes summary cards showing total amount, pending amount, and received amount
2. **Visual Status Indicators**: Status is represented with color-coded badges and progress bars
3. **Type Classification**: Different incentive types are visually distinguished with color-coded badges
4. **Filtering System**: Rich filtering options by type, status, and date
5. **Tabbed Detail View**: Organized display of comprehensive incentive information
6. **Status Timeline**: Visual representation of the incentive's progression through various statuses
