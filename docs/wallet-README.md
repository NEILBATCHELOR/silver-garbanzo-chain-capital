- **Database foundation** - Basic wallet tables exist

### ‚ùå Critical Gaps (60% Missing)
- **No HD wallet implementation** - Missing BIP32/39/44 standards
- **No key management system** - Development-grade security only
- **No transaction orchestration** - Cannot build/sign transactions
- **No multi-signature backend** - UI only, no actual coordination
- **No professional custody** - Database tables only, no API integration
- **No compliance infrastructure** - Missing AML/KYC screening

4. **Start regulatory research:** MSB licensing requirements for your jurisdiction

### **Next Week (If Proceeding)**
1. **Start Phase 1 development:** Implement WalletService.ts first
2. **Database migration:** Add HD wallet metadata tables
3. **Security planning:** Begin HSM integration research
4. **Custody provider outreach:** Contact DFNS, Fireblocks for partnerships

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Risk Warning

**Without core crypto infrastructure:**
- Cannot obtain crypto business licenses (MSB, state licenses)
- Cannot serve institutional clients requiring true custody
- Cannot compete with established crypto wallet providers
- Regulatory compliance requirements cannot be met
- Limited to wallet connection services only

**Your excellent UI foundation provides a competitive advantage, but only if paired with professional-grade crypto infrastructure.**

## üèÜ Competitive Position

**Current Position:** Sophisticated wallet connector with excellent UX  
**Potential Position:** Full-featured institutional crypto wallet  
**Market Opportunity:** $2B+ crypto wallet and custody market  
**Timeline to Competitive Position:** 8-16 weeks with proper investment
