- **Build Status**: ✅ Successful (verified)
- **Architecture**: Modern component-based with optimized hooks
- **User Experience**: Improved loading times and cleaner interface

## 🗑️ Legacy File Removal Pending

### Ready for Removal (Confirm First)

**1. Unused Legacy Component:**
```
src/components/tokens/components/TokenEditForm.tsx
```
- ❌ **Not imported anywhere**
- 📝 **311 lines of legacy code**
- ✅ **Safe to remove**

**2. Backup Dashboard:**
```
src/components/tokens/pages/LegacyTokenDashboardPage.tsx
```
- 📁 **Backup of original dashboard**
- 📝 **1,318 lines**
- ⚠️ **Consider keeping for 1-2 weeks as insurance**

### Still In Use (DO NOT REMOVE)
Legacy forms in `/forms/` directory are still used by:
- `CreateTokenPage.tsx`
- `TokenEditDialog.tsx` 
- `TokenEditPage.tsx`

## Next Steps

### Immediate Action Required
**Please confirm which files to remove:**

#### Option A: Conservative (Recommended)
```bash
# Remove only the confirmed unused file
rm src/components/tokens/components/TokenEditForm.tsx
```

#### Option B: Aggressive Cleanup
```bash
# Remove both legacy files
rm src/components/tokens/components/TokenEditForm.tsx
rm src/components/tokens/pages/LegacyTokenDashboardPage.tsx
```

#### Option C: Keep Everything
Keep all files as insurance until further testing.

### Future Tasks
1. **Test optimized dashboard** thoroughly in production
2. **Migrate remaining components** to comprehensive form system
3. **Remove legacy forms** once all dependencies updated
4. **Clean up documentation** and update team guidelines
