## 🚀 Usage Examples

### **Basic HSM Operations**
```typescript
import { createHSMService, getEnvConfig } from './services/wallets/hsm'

// Create HSM service with environment configuration
const hsmService = createHSMService(getEnvConfig())

// Store wallet keys (uses HSM if available, memory fallback)
const result = await hsmService.storeWalletKeys(keyData)
console.log(`Operation successful: ${result.success}`)

// Generate secure keys
const keyResult = await hsmService.generateSecureKeys('wallet-123', 'secp256k1')
console.log(`HSM Generated: ${keyResult.data.hsmGenerated}`)

// Sign with hardware security
const signature = await hsmService.signWithSecureKey(keyId, data, 'ECDSA_SHA_256')
console.log(`HSM Signed: ${signature.data.hsmSigned}`)
```
