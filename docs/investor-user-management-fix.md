# Investor User Management Fix

## Issue Fixed
Fixed the database error during investor user account creation with the following improvements:

1. **Enhanced Auth User Creation**
   - Fixed the "Database error creating new user" issue in enhanced-user-service.ts
   - Implemented proper user checking before creation to prevent duplicate errors
   - Added robust error handling and cleanup procedures

2. **User-Investor Association**
   - Ensured proper association between investors and user accounts
   - Implemented profile type handling to ensure "investor" profile type
   - Added proper error handling during database operations

3. **Email Invitation Management**
   - Created dedicated InvestorInvitation service for handling email invitations
   - Implemented rate limiting for bulk email sending (1 email every 5 seconds)
   - Added resend invitation functionality

4. **User Deletion Workflow**
   - Created InvestorUserDeletion service for complete deletion workflow
   - Ensured deletion in correct order to satisfy database constraints
   - Added options to unlink without deleting or complete deletion

## Implementation Details

### Key Components Modified:
- `enhanced-user-service.ts`: Fixed the auth user creation issue with improved error handling
- `InvestorUserService.ts`: Updated user association workflow
- Created `InvestorInvitation.ts`: New service for email invitation management
- Created `InvestorUserDeletion.ts`: New service for user deletion workflow

### Database Operations:
The implementation properly handles:
1. **Creating Users**: In auth.users and public.users tables
2. **Creating Profiles**: With profile_type set to "investor" 
3. **User Roles**: Assigning the investor role to users
4. **Investor Updates**: Setting user_id, profile_id, and profile_type fields

### Error Handling & Recovery:
- Robust error handling at each step of the process
- Cleanup procedures to avoid orphaned records
- Retry mechanisms for database operations

## Usage Guide

### Creating Investor User Accounts:
```typescript
// Create a user account for an investor
await investorUserService.createUserAccountForInvestor({
  investorId: "investor-uuid",
  email: "investor@example.com",
  name: "Investor Name",
  password: "optional-password", // Leave empty to auto-generate
  sendInvite: false // Set to true to send invite immediately
});
```

### Sending Invitations:
```typescript
// Send a one-off invitation
await investorInvitationService.sendInvestorInvite({
  investorId: "investor-uuid",
  userId: "user-uuid",
  email: "investor@example.com",
  name: "Investor Name"
});

// Send bulk invitations with rate limiting
await investorInvitationService.sendBulkInvites({
  investorIds: ["id1", "id2", "id3"],
  delaySeconds: 5, // 5 seconds between emails
  investorInfo: {
    "id1": { userId: "user1", email: "investor1@example.com", name: "Investor 1" },
    "id2": { userId: "user2", email: "investor2@example.com", name: "Investor 2" },
    "id3": { userId: "user3", email: "investor3@example.com", name: "Investor 3" }
  }
}, (progress) => {
  // Progress callback
  console.log(`Progress: ${progress.completed}/${progress.total}`);
});
```

### Deleting/Unlinking Users:
```typescript
// Unlink user from investor (keeps user account)
await investorUserDeletionService.unlinkInvestorUser("investor-uuid");

// Complete deletion of user account
await investorUserDeletionService.deleteInvestorUserCompletely("investor-uuid");
```

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test creating users for investors with different scenarios:
   - New user creation
   - Linking existing user
   - Error handling

2. Test email invitation functionality:
   - Single invitations
   - Bulk invitations with rate limiting
   - Resend invitations

3. Test deletion workflows:
   - Unlinking users from investors
   - Complete deletion of user accounts

4. Verify database consistency:
   - Check proper associations between tables
   - Ensure no orphaned records after operations
