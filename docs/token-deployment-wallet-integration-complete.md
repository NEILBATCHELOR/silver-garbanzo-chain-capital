## Database Schema Verification ✅

Confirmed the `project_wallets` table exists with the exact schema specified:

```sql
CREATE TABLE public.project_wallets (
  id uuid NOT NULL DEFAULT extensions.uuid_generate_v4(),
  project_id uuid NOT NULL,
  wallet_type text NOT NULL,
  wallet_address text NOT NULL,
  public_key text NOT NULL,
  private_key text NULL,
  mnemonic text NULL,
  key_vault_id text NULL,
  created_at timestamp with time zone NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
  updated_at timestamp with time zone NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
  CONSTRAINT project_wallets_pkey PRIMARY KEY (id),
  CONSTRAINT uq_project_wallets_wallet_address UNIQUE (wallet_address),
  CONSTRAINT project_wallets_project_id_fkey FOREIGN KEY (project_id) REFERENCES projects (id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);
```

## Technical Implementation Details

### Service Layer Architecture
- **tokenProjectWalletIntegrationService**: Main integration service
- **enhancedProjectWalletService**: Database operations and wallet generation
- **WalletGeneratorFactory**: Multi-network wallet generation
- **Ethers.js integration**: For Ethereum-compatible chains
- **UUID generation**: For secure key vault IDs and request tracking

### Component Architecture
- **Auto/Manual toggle**: Switch between automatic wallet management and manual entry
- **Network-aware**: Automatically loads appropriate wallets when network changes
- **State management**: Comprehensive state for loading, errors, wallet results, and UI controls
- **Security-first**: Private keys only shown when explicitly requested by user

### Integration Points
- **Project Context**: Uses project ID for wallet association
- **Token Deployment**: Seamlessly integrates with existing token deployment flow
- **Database**: Direct integration with Supabase project_wallets table
- **UI Components**: Uses consistent Radix UI components and styling

## User Experience Improvements

### Before Integration (Manual Process)
- Users had to manually enter wallet addresses
- Private keys required manual input
- No wallet management or persistence
- Risk of typos and security issues
- No network-specific wallet organization

### After Integration (Automated Process) ✅
- **Automatic wallet creation** for each network
- **Persistent wallet storage** in project database
- **One-click wallet switching** between networks
- **Secure private key management** with optional visibility
- **Copy-to-clipboard** functionality for easy access
- **Network-specific organization** of project wallets
- **Reuse existing wallets** to prevent duplicates
- **Force new wallet generation** when needed
