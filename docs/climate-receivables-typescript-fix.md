# Climate Receivables Module TypeScript Error Fix

## Overview

This document details the fixes made to resolve TypeScript errors in the Climate Receivables module. The errors were primarily related to naming convention mismatches between the database schema (which uses snake_case) and the TypeScript code (which was incorrectly using camelCase).

## Files Updated

1. `cash-flow-forecasting-service.ts`
2. `risk-assessment-service.ts`
3. `tokenization-service.ts`
4. `types/index.ts`

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Property Access Naming

Changed camelCase property accesses to snake_case to match the database schema:

- `dueDate` → `due_date`
- `projectionId` → `projection_id`
- `projectionDate` → `projection_date`
- `projectedAmount` → `projected_amount`
- `sourceType` → `source_type`
- `receivableId` → `receivable_id`
- `expectedReceiptDate` → `expected_receipt_date`
- `riskScore` → `risk_score`
- `productionRisk` → `production_risk`
- `creditRisk` → `credit_risk` 
- `policyRisk` → `policy_risk`
- `financialHealthScore` → `financial_health_score`
- `creditRating` → `credit_rating`
- `impactLevel` → `impact_level`
- `discountRate` → `discount_rate`
- `totalValue` → `total_value`
- `poolId` → `pool_id`
- `createdAt` → `created_at`
- `updatedAt` → `updated_at`

### 2. Added Missing Types

Added two missing type definitions to the `types/index.ts` file:

- `UUID` type alias
- `TokenClimateProperties` interface

### 3. Updated Return Object Properties

Updated the property names in objects being returned from functions to match the database schema:

- In `createPool()` in `tokenization-service.ts`
- In `calculateTokenProperties()` in `tokenization-service.ts`
- In cash flow projection functions in `cash-flow-forecasting-service.ts`

## Coding Standards

This fix ensures adherence to the Chain Capital coding standards, where:
- Database & SQL use snake_case (e.g., `due_date`, `risk_score`)
- TypeScript/JavaScript use camelCase for variables and functions, but property names that reference database fields maintain snake_case

## Benefits

1. Fixed all TypeScript errors
2. Ensured consistent naming convention across database and code
3. Improved type safety and error detection
4. Better alignment with existing codebase practices

## Next Steps

The module is now free of TypeScript errors and ready for further development. Future work should maintain this database-aligned naming convention for consistency.
