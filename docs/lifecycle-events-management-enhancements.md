## Features Added

This update enhances the Product Lifecycle Management system with two important features:

1. **Status Change Capability**: 
   - Added the ability to change the status of lifecycle events directly from the event cards
   - Status changes are immediately reflected in the UI and database
   - Visual indicators for different statuses with color-coding

2. **Bulk Upload from CSV**:
   - Added a new dialog for uploading multiple lifecycle events at once from a CSV file
   - Implemented CSV template download with sample data
   - Added validation for uploaded CSV files to ensure data integrity
   - Support for all event types and fields
   - Batch processing to handle large uploads efficiently

## Implementation Details

### Status Change Feature

The status change feature adds a dropdown menu to each lifecycle event card allowing users to easily update the status:

- Status options include: Pending, Success, Failed, Processing, Cancelled
- Each status has a distinct color for visual identification
- Changes are processed through the `updateEventStatus` method in the `lifecycleService`
- Real-time UI updates through Supabase subscriptions

### Bulk Upload Feature

The bulk upload feature provides a streamlined way to import multiple events:

1. **Template Download**:
   - Users can download a CSV template with the required fields
   - The template includes sample data for reference

2. **File Upload**:
   - Drag-and-drop or file selection interface
   - Preview of the first few rows before confirmation

3. **Validation**:
   - Validation of required fields (event type, event date)
   - Format checking (dates, numeric values)
   - Error messages for invalid data

4. **Processing**:
   - Batch processing to avoid request size limits
   - Progress indicators during upload
   - Success confirmation with event count

5. **Integration**:
   - Events are immediately visible in the timeline and cards views
   - Real-time updates through Supabase subscriptions
