# Audit Logging Without Duplication

## Problem Solved
This implementation re-enables audit logging while preventing the record duplication issues that were occurring with the previous proxy-based approach.

## New Approach: Event-Based Audit Logging
Instead of using JavaScript Proxies that intercept database operations (which caused duplicate records), we now use an event-based approach where:

1. Database operations are performed directly with the Supabase client
2. Audit logging happens after the operation completes successfully
3. Logging occurs outside the main execution path using setTimeout

## How to Use the Enhanced Operations

### Before (Original approach with duplication issues)
```typescript
// This would sometimes cause duplicate records
const { data, error } = await supabase
  .from('projects')
  .insert({ name: 'New Project', status: 'active' });
```

### After (New approach without duplication)
```typescript
// This prevents duplication while still logging the operation
const { data, error } = await enhancedOperations
  .insert('projects', { name: 'New Project', status: 'active' });
```

## API Overview

The `enhancedOperations` object provides the following methods:

1. **insert**: Create new records with audit logging
   ```typescript
   const result = await enhancedOperations.insert('table_name', dataObject, options);
   ```

2. **update**: Update records with audit logging
   ```typescript
   const result = await enhancedOperations.update('table_name', dataObject, {
     eq: { id: 123 } // Use eq for equality filters
   });
   ```

3. **upsert**: Insert or update records with audit logging
   ```typescript
   const result = await enhancedOperations.upsert('table_name', dataObject, options);
   ```

4. **delete**: Delete records with audit logging
   ```typescript
   const result = await enhancedOperations.delete('table_name', {
     eq: { id: 123 } // Use eq for equality filters
   });
   ```

5. **select**: Standard select operations (no audit logging needed)
   ```typescript
   // Just returns the standard Supabase query builder
   const query = enhancedOperations.select('table_name');
   ```

## Why This Approach Prevents Duplication

1. **No Proxy Interception**: Operations aren't intercepted and modified mid-execution
2. **Post-Operation Logging**: Audit logs are created only after operations complete successfully
3. **Asynchronous Decoupling**: Logging happens in a separate execution context via setTimeout
4. **Error Isolation**: Errors in audit logging won't affect the main database operations

## Migration Guide

To migrate your code to use this new approach:

1. Search for all instances of direct Supabase data modification:
   - `supabase.from('table_name').insert`
   - `supabase.from('table_name').update`
   - `supabase.from('table_name').upsert`
   - `supabase.from('table_name').delete`

2. Replace them with the equivalent enhancedOperations methods

3. Read operations can continue to use the standard Supabase client
