## üé® Visual Improvements

### Before
```
‚ùå Cramped inline toggles without descriptions
‚ùå Inconsistent badge alignment using ml-auto
‚ùå No multi-entry capabilities for addresses/countries
‚ùå Poor visual hierarchy and spacing
‚ùå Inconsistent toggle placement
```

### After
```
‚úÖ Each toggle on its own row with clear descriptions
‚úÖ Consistent badge alignment using AccordionSection
‚úÖ Multi-entry fields with validation for addresses and countries
‚úÖ Clean visual hierarchy with proper spacing
‚úÖ Dark mode support throughout
‚úÖ Professional, accessible interface
```

## üß© Implementation Patterns

### Standard Toggle Implementation
```typescript
// New clean pattern
<SwitchField
  label="Enable Feature"
  description="Clear description of what this feature does"
  checked={config.featureEnabled}
  onCheckedChange={(checked) => handleChange("featureEnabled", checked)}
/>
```

### Multi-Entry Field Implementation
```typescript
<MultiEntryField
  label="Whitelisted Addresses"
  description="Ethereum addresses allowed to receive tokens"
  placeholder="0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b8D44C5dB8678C6323"
  values={config.whitelist_addresses}
  onValuesChange={(values) => handleChange("whitelist_addresses", values)}
  validation={validateEthereumAddress}
  validationError="Please enter a valid Ethereum address"
  maxItems={100}
/>
```

### Accordion Section Implementation
```typescript
<AccordionSection
  value="section-id"
  title="Section Title"
  badge={{ type: "enterprise", text: "Enterprise" }}
>
  {/* content */}
</AccordionSection>
```

## üîß Database Integration

### New Fields Added
- `geographic_restrictions: string[]` - ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country codes
- `whitelist_addresses: string[]` - Ethereum addresses for whitelisting
- Enhanced boolean flags for various features

### Validation Helpers
- **`validateEthereumAddress`** - Validates 0x[40 hex chars] format
- **`validateCountryCode`** - Validates ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 codes (US, GB, etc.)
- **`validateDomainName`** - Basic domain validation

## üì± Features Added

### Multi-Entry Management
- Add/remove multiple entries with validation
- Visual feedback for invalid entries
- Duplicate prevention
- Maximum item limits
- Clean badge-based display

### Geographic Restrictions
- Support for multiple country codes
- ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 validation
- User-friendly interface for compliance requirements

### Whitelist Management
- Multiple Ethereum addresses support
- Real-time validation
- Easy management interface

## üöÄ Impact
