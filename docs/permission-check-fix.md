# Permission Check Fix

## Issue Description
Users were encountering "Permission Denied" errors when trying to generate wallet credentials, even when they had the necessary permissions (including Super Admin status). The console logs showed multiple errors:

```
Error checking permission: {code: 'PGRST116', details: 'The result contains 2 rows', hint: null, message: 'JSON object requested, multiple (or no) rows returned'}
```

## Root Cause
The `check_user_permission` PostgreSQL function was failing when users had multiple roles assigned. The function was:

1. Using a `SELECT INTO` statement to get the user's role name, which fails with multiple rows
2. Not properly handling the case when a user has multiple roles

## Solution
The fixed function:

1. Checks if the user has a Super Admin role using `EXISTS` which works with multiple rows
2. Directly returns TRUE for Super Admins
3. For other users, checks permissions across all their roles
4. Uses proper error handling to ensure the function doesn't fail

## Implementation
Apply the SQL in `permission-check-fix.sql` to update the `check_user_permission` function.

## Verification Steps
1. Apply the SQL fix to your database
2. Test wallet generation with users who have multiple roles
3. Verify Super Admin users have all permissions regardless of explicit permissions

## Additional Notes
The original function was using a non-resilient approach to role checking. This fix makes the permission system work correctly with the current database schema without requiring any schema changes.
